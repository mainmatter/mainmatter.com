Being a frontend developer requires knowledge in a variety of fields. Consistent
practice and taking up small challenges every day have helped Gabor improve to
the point where he is able to ship great results within short time frames.

Despite the common wrong assumptions about IT workers, Gabor is aware of the
importance of people skills in a developer job and recommends his peers not to
underestimate it.

When he is not working, Gabor enjoys spending time with his family, often
cooking for them. He also practices fencing and regularly partakes in
competitions.

In Inside simplabs, we take you behind the scenes and interview our team
members. They share valuable insights on their jobs as well as their personal
interests, hobbies, and goals.

## News

#### Ricardo Mendes from the Ember.js Core Team joins simplabs

We're very excited to announce that [Ricardo Mendes](https://twitter.com/locks) from the Ember.js core team has joined simplabs.

Before Ricardo joined the team we were pleased to sponsor him through the Ember.js sponsorship program. Chris Manson spent his 20% time pairing with Ricardo on [Guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) to add features to help the Ember Octane documentation process and released a 1.0 of Guidemaker.

Our CEO Marco says _"We are very excited to welcome Ricardo Mendes to simplabs. Being a long-term member of the Ember Core Team, we have been in touch with him for years already. His deep knowledge and teaching ability will be hugely beneficial for our clients."_

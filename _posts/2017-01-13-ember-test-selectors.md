In March 2016 we have released the first version of
[ember-test-selectors](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors) and
today we are proud to present you our next milestone: `0.1.0`.

While `0.1.0` does not sound like much has changed, the addon has actually
gained a lot of new functionality and should be considered our release candidate
for `1.0.0`.

This blog post will highlight the major changes in this release, and will
give you a short introduction into _how_ we have implemented these new
features.

<!--break-->

## Automatic binding of `data-test-*` properties

As you may know from our [previous blog post](/blog/2016/03/04/ember-test-selectors)
on this topic, the goal of this addon is to let you use attributes starting
with `data-test-` in your templates:

```handlebars
<article>
  <h1 data-test-post-title>{{post.title}}</h1>
  <p>{{post.body}}</p>
</article>
```

... so that you can use these as selectors in your acceptance and integration tests:

```js
assert.equal(find(testSelector('post-title')).text(), 'my first blog post');
//           find( '[data-test-post-title]' )
```

While this worked well on HTML tags, using the same pattern on components was
a little more complicated. The assigned `data-test-*` properties needed to be
bound to HTML attributes by adding them to the `attributeBindings` array on
the component class.

One of the major changes in this new release is that modifying the
`attributeBindings` array is now done automatically for you, so that you can
just assign `data-test-*` properties in your templates and they will
automatically appear on the `<div>` tag wrapping the component:

```handlebars
{{comments-list data-test-comments-for=post.id}}
```

```html
<div id="ember123" data-test-comments-for="42">
  <!-- comments -->
</div>
```

### How we implemented this

Since we wanted to make this feature available on all components by default
we had to `reopen()` the `Ember.Component` class, figure out the list of
`data-test-*` properties on the component, and then add them to the
`attributeBindings` array.

The natural way to do this within an addon is using an [initializer](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.10.0/applications/initializers/),
so that is what we [did](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors/blob/v0.1.0/addon/initializers/ember-test-selectors.js#L5-L10).
Instead of putting all the logic in the initializer itself, we have extracted
it into a [`bindDataTestAttributes()`](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors/blob/v0.1.0/addon/utils/bind-data-test-attributes.js)
function, which we were now able to [unit test](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors/blob/v0.1.0/tests/unit/utils/bind-data-test-attributes-test.js)
separately.

As we are committed to not including any unnecessary code in your
production builds, we also had to make sure to not include the
initializer and utility function in there. Since both of those are part
of our `addon` and `app` folders, which are included in your builds by
default, we borrowed a ["trick"](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-chai/blob/master/index.js#L119-L123)
from [ember-cli-chai](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-chai/) which
only includes both folders if we are in [testing mode](#testing-in-production-mode).

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...

  treeForAddon: function() {
    // only include our "addon" folder in the build if we're testing
    if (this.app.tests) {
      return this._super.treeForAddon.apply(this, arguments);
    }
  },

  treeForApp: function() {
    // only include our "app" folder in the build if we're testing
    if (this.app.tests) {
      return this._super.treeForApp.apply(this, arguments);
    }
  },
};
```

**UPDATE:** After releasing `0.1.0` we were notified that this feature was
not working for component integration tests, which was actually a pretty
obvious problem as initializers are not running for these kinds of
tests. After thinking about the issue for a few hours we came up with a
solution that seems to work even better now. Instead of calling
`Component.reopen()` in an initializer we are now doing it in a file in our
`vendor` folder, which is always being run before any tests are executed.

We have released `0.1.1` including this change and are now also warning you
if you try to use `data-test-*` attributes on tagless components.

## Stripping out `data-test-*` attributes in templates

Our initial goal with this library was stripping our `data-test-*` attributes
from HTML tags in your templates. In the previous section we implemented
automatic bindings for `data-test-*` properties on components now too, but
these properties were not stripped from the template yet.

To modify templates from within an addon our best bet was to use an
<abbr title="Abstract Syntax Tree">AST</abbr> transform on the Handlebars
AST, that we get from the template parser. This can be accomplished by
registering a Handlebars AST plugin in the
[`setupPreprocessorRegistry()`](https://ember-cli.com/api/classes/Addon.html#method_setupPreprocessorRegistry)
hook of the addon:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
module.exports = {
  // ...

  setupPreprocessorRegistry: function(type, registry) {
    if (type === 'parent' && !this.app.tests) {
      registry.add('htmlbars-ast-plugin', {
        name: 'strip-test-selectors',
        plugin: require('./strip-test-selectors'),
        baseDir: function() { return __dirname; }
      });
    }
  },
};
```

While this AST transform already existed in the previous releases, it was only
able to handle `data-test-*` attributes on HTML tags (called `ElementNode`),
but not on curly components yet:

```js
var TEST_SELECTOR_PREFIX = /data-test-.*/;

module.exports = class {
  transform(ast) {
    var walker = new this.syntax.Walker();

    walker.visit(ast, function(node) {
      if (node.type === 'ElementNode') {
        node.attributes = node.attributes.filter(function(attribute) {
          return !TEST_SELECTOR_PREFIX.test(attribute.name);
        });
      }
    });

    return ast;
  }
};
```

You can try out what this transform does in the
[AST explorer](https://astexplorer.net/#/5ZDpdTbKwL).

Fortunately for us the code to make this AST transform work for curly
components is very similar:

```js
if (node.type === 'MustacheStatement' || node.type === 'BlockStatement') {
  node.hash.pairs = node.hash.pairs.filter(function(pair) {
    return !TEST_SELECTOR_PREFIX.test(pair.key);
  });
}
```

If you try the same example template in the
[AST explorer](https://astexplorer.net/#/8wkrolD3V0), but with the modified
transform code, you will notice that the `data-test-comment-id=comment.id` part
of the `some-component` invocation is now gone.

## Stripping out `data-test-*` properties in JS files

While one way of assigning data attributes to a component is in the template,
data attributes can also be defined as properties on the component class.
So instead of assigning `data-test-comment-id` inside the loop:

```handlebars
{{#each comments as |comment|}}
  {{comment-list-item comment=comment data-test-comment-id=comment.id}}
{{/each}}
```

... we could also use a computed property inside the component that mirrors
`comment.id`:

```js
export default Ember.Component({
  comment: null,
  'data-test-comment-id': Ember.computed.readOnly('comment.id'),
});
```

Unfortunately we have now have a property that is not stripped by the AST
transform described in the previous section. At this point we could have
used a similar strategy as before and added a JavaScript preprocessor, that
strips all those properties from the code, but instead we hooked into the
existing JavaScript processing pipeline using [Babel](http://babeljs.io/).

Fortunately for us the fantastic [AST explorer](https://astexplorer.net/)
also supports prototyping Babel plugins and so we came up with a simple
[plugin](https://astexplorer.net/#/xd5PB1rSD6) that basically just
removes `data-test-*` properties from all the objects in your code:

```js
var TEST_SELECTOR_PREFIX = /data-test-.*/;

module.exports = function(babel) {
  return new babel.Plugin('ember-test-selectors', {
    visitor: {
      Property: function(node) {
        if (TEST_SELECTOR_PREFIX.test(node.key.value)) {
          this.dangerouslyRemove();
        }
      },
    },
  });
};
```

With the Babel plugin done, all we had left to do was making sure that your
app actually uses that plugin at build time. While this is not quite public
API and may change in the future we have found a way to accomplish that in the
official [ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile/blob/v0.3.6/index.js#L64-L69)
addon:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...

  included: function(app) {
    this._super.included.apply(this, arguments);

    // add the StripDataTestPropertiesPlugin to the list of plugins used by
    // the `ember-cli-babel` addon
    if (!app.tests) {
      app.options = app.options || {};
      app.options.babel = app.options.babel || {};
      app.options.babel.plugins = app.options.babel.plugins || [];

      app.options.babel.plugins.push(require('./strip-data-test-properties-plugin'));
    }
  },
};
```

## Testing in `production` mode

In our previous releases we had offered an `environments` option to let you
choose when to strip attributes and when to keep them in the templates. The
default of this option was set to `['production']`, which made sense at the
time.

Since then we had discovered though that this will keep you from running your
tests in `production` mode using `ember test --environment=production`.
Instead of just checking the `environment` we are now making use of the
([not yet documented](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/6656))
`tests` property on the `EmberApp` class in Ember CLI.

This property will be `true` when using the `development` environment with
either `ember build`, `ember serve` or `ember test`, or it will be `true`
when using `ember test --environment=production`. That makes sure that we
still strip all the `data-test-*` attributes from your code in production
builds, but you should now again be able to also test your production builds
using test selectors.

Since we previously offered an option to override our defaults, we were
committed to doing the same for the new defaults. For this we have deprecated
this existing `environments` option, and introduced a new `strip` option,
which can be set to `true` or `false`, but defaults to the `tests` property
described above:

```js
var app = new EmberApp({
  'ember-test-selectors': {
    strip: false,
  },
});
```

Note that using the `environments` option still works, but is deprecated and
will be removed by the time we release `1.0.0`.

## Simplified `testSelector()` import

The `testSelector()` helper function can be used to simplify building the
CSS/jQuery selector strings used for `find()` or `this.$()` in your tests.
Previously you had to import that function from `<app-name>/tests/helpers/ember-test-selectors`,
but since our `addon` folder is now removed from the build in production
we were able to simplify that import to just this:

```js
import testSelector from 'ember-test-selectors';
```

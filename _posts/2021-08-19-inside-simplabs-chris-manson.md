We are happy to introduce to you our senior software engineer: Chris!

Chris' expertise and passion for EmberJS make him a great programmer and team
member. When he is not busy coding or fixing bugs, he even likes to stream on
Twitch to share his knowledge with others.

To those who aspire to become successful software developers, he says: "try and
get as many diverse inputs as you possibly can if you are working in a team."

Chris is also a loving father to two wonderful kids and enjoys playing the piano
outside of work.

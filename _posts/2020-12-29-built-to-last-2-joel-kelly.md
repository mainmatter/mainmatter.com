simplabs' Built to Last interview series goes behind-the-scenes into successful
product development processes. We'll take a look from the perspective of
industry insiders, exploring their personal experiences, struggles, and
learnings.

Joel shares the following key learning with us:

''It is fundamental that the engineering and product development team are
working together really closely for the whole time until the product is fully
developed and even after, so they can adapt quickly to what's going on.''

Thanks a lot for the valuable insights, Joel Kelly.

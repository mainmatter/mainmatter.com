As a Software Engineer, Daniel is often facing complicated problems that require
lots of research and dedication. His tip for any developer is to commit to
finding a solution even if it takes longer than expected. Communication and
collaboration within the team are also crucial to Danielâ€™s work.

Outside of work, Daniel has various unusual projects. He is even planning to
build a house for himself out of bamboo one day!

In Inside simplabs, we take you behind the scenes and interview our team
members. They share valuable insights on their jobs as well as their personal
interests, hobbies, and goals.

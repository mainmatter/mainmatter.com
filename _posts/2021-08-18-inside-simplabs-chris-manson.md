We are happy to introduce to you our senior software engineer: Chris!

Chris' expertise and passion for EmberJS make him a great programmer and team member. When he is not busy coding or fixing bugs, he even likes to stream on Twitch to share his knowledge with others. 

To those who aspire to become successful software developers, he says: "try and get as many diverse inputs as you possibly can if you are working in a team."

Chris is also a loving father to two wonderful kids and enjoys playing the piano outside of work. 

In Inside simplabs, we take you behind the scenes and interview our team members. They share valuable insights on their jobs as well as their personal interests, hobbies, and goals. 

Get to know the simplabs team!

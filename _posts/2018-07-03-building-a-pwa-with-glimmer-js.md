We recently set out to build a progressive web app with
[Glimmer.js](http://glimmerjs.com). Instead of building it with
[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com), which is our standard framework of choice, we
wanted to see how suitable for prime-time Glimmer.js is and what we'd be able
to accomplish with it. To put it short, we are really happy with how building
the app went and the result that we were able to achieve. In this series of
posts, we will give some insights into how we built the app, why we made
particular decisions and what the result looks like.

## Breethe

While this project was mostly meant as a technology spike to validate Glimmer's
suitability for real projects as well as testing some techniques for running
and serving web apps that we had in our minds for some time, we wanted to build
something useful and meaningful. What we came up with is
[Breethe](https://breethe.app), a progressive web app that gives users quick
and easy access to air quality data for locations around the world. Pollution
and global warming are getting worse rather than better and having easy access
to data that shows how bad the situation actually is, is the first step for
everyone to question their decisions and maybe change a few things in their
daily lives.

The application is open source and
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/simplabs/breethe-client).

## Glimmer.js

Glimmer.js is a thin component library built on top of Ember.js's rendering
engine, the Glimmer VM. It is optimized for small application bundle sizes and
maximum runtime performance and thus a great fit for situations where a
full-featured framework like Ember.js is not needed and too heavyweight.

Glimmer.js provides functionality for defining, composing and rendering
components and keeps the DOM in sync with the component tree's internal state.
It uses Ember CLI, the battle-tested command-line interface tool (CLI) from the
Ember project, to help create and manage applications. Glimmer.js is written in
TypeScript and so are applications built with it.

Glimmer.js templates use Handlebars-like syntax, e.g.:

```hbs
{{#each measurementLists.first key="@index"}}
  <MeasurementRow
    @value={{measurement.value}}
    @parameter={{measurement.parameter}}
    @unit={{measurement.unit}}
  />
{{/each}}
```

These templates then get compiled to bytecode that the Glimmer VM (yes, this is
a full-fledged VM that runs inside the JavaScript VM inside the browser)
processes and translates into DOM operations. For a detailed overview of how
that works and why it results in very small bundle sizes as well as super fast
initial and update renders, watch the talk I gave at the
[Ember.js Munich](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Munich/) meetup last year:

## Building Breethe with Glimmer.js

The Breethe app consists of two main screens, the Start page with the search
form and the results page that shows the data and an air quality score for a
particular location. These two screens are implemented via two components so
that depending on the current state of the app, the correct one is rendered.

![The two main screens of the Breethe PWA](/assets/images/posts/2018-07-03-building-a-pwa-with-glimmer-js/breethe-screens.png)

As Glimmer.js is _"only"_ a UI component library and does not include any
routing functionality, we used the [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo)
router to set up logic that maps the current URL to the corresponding
application state and vice versa:

```ts
_setupRouting() {
  this.router = new Navigo();

  this.router
    .on('/', () => this.mode = MODE_SEARCH)

    .on('/search', () => this.mode = MODE_SEARCH)

    .on('/search/:searchTerm', (params) => {
      this.mode = MODE_SEARCH;
      this.searchTerm = params.searchTerm;
     })

     .on('/location/:locationId/', (params) => {
       this.mode = MODE_RESULTS;
       this.searchTerm = params.locationId;
     })

    .resolve(this.appState.route);
}
```

First of all, we create a new router instance. We then map URLs to the
corresponding states of the app. The routes `/`, `/search` and
`/search/:searchTerm` all map to the `MODE_SEARCH` mode that renders the search
form and search results if there are any. The `/location/:locationId` route
maps to the `MODE_RESULTS` mode that renders a particular location's data and
quality score. We use the `mode` property in two tracked properties
`isSearchMode` and `isResultsMode`.
[Tracked properties](https://glimmerjs.com/guides/tracked-properties) are
Glimmer's equivalent to Ember's computed properties and will result in the
component being re-rendered when their value changes.

```ts
@tracked('mode')
get isSearchMode(): boolean {
  return this.mode === MODE_SEARCH;
}

@tracked('mode')
get isResultsMode(): boolean {
  return this.mode === MODE_RESULTS;
}
```

These tracked properties are then used in the template to render the respective
component for the current mode:

```hbs
{{#if isSearchMode}}
  <Search @searchTerm={{searchTerm}}/>
{{else if isResultsMode}}
  <Location @locationId={{locationId}} />
{{/if}}
```

You might notice the `@` prefix of the `searchTerm` and `locationId` properties
that are set on the components. This prefix distinguishes properties that are
to be passed to the component instance as opposed to attributes that will be
applied to the component's root DOM element.

The `Search` component renders the `SearchForm` component that implements the
text field for the search term and the button to submit the search:

```hbs
<SearchForm
  @term={{searchTerm}}
  @onSubmit={{action searchByTerm}}
/>
```

`@onSubmit={{action searchByTerm}}` assigns the
`searchByTerm` method of the `Search` component as an action to the `@onSubmit`
property of the `SearchForm` component. Whenever the search form is submitted,
the `SearchForm` component invokes the assigned action:

```ts
submitSearch(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  let search = event.target.value;
  this.args.onSubmit(search);
 }
```

The last line calls the assigned action and thus invokes the `searchByTerm`
method on the `Search` component. That method enables the loading state on the
component, loads locations matching the search term, assigns them to its
`locations` property and disables the loading state again:

```ts
async searchByTerm(searchTerm) {
  this.loading = true;
  let url = `${__ENV_API_HOST__}/api/locations?filter[name]=${searchTerm}`;
  let locationsResponse = await fetch(url);
  let locationsPayload: { data: Location[] } = await locationsResponse.json();
  this.locations = locationsPayload.data;
  this.loading = false;
}
```

The `loading` and `locations` properties are tracked properties so that
changing them results in the component to be re-rendered. They are used in the
template like this:

```hbs
<div class="results">
  {{#if loading}}
    <div class="loader search-loader"></div>
  {{else}}
    <ul>
      {{#each locations key="id" as |location|}}
        <li class="result">
          <a href="/location/{{location.id}}" class="result-link" data-internal>
            {{location.label}}
          </a>
        </li>
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
  {{/if}}
</div>
```

This is just a brief overview of how an application built with Glimmer.js
works. We will cover some of these things in more detail in future posts,
particularly how we load and manage data with Orbit.js. For a closer look on
the inner workings of Breethe, check out the
[code on github](https://github.com/simplabs/breethe-client).

## From Glimmer.js to Ember.js

Besides making the Glimmer VM available to be used outside of Ember.js and
offering a solution for situations where bundle size and load time performance
is of crucial importance, Glimmer.js also serves as a testbed for new features
and changes that will later make their way into the Ember.js framework. It is
not bound to the strong stability guarantees that Ember.js offers and thus a
great environment for experimenting with new approaches to existing problems
that will usually require a few iterations until the API becomes stable.

Some new things that originate in experiments done in Glimmer.js have already
found their way back into Ember.js (at least in some form):

- The `@` syntax as shown above that clearly distinguishes properties that are
  set on a component instance vs. attributes that are set on a component's root
  DOM element -
  [this PR](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/4bd3d7b882484919682ab0cdb57f81584abc503a)
  enables the feature flag by default.
- The possibility to use ES2015 classes instead of Ember.js' own object model -
  see
  [this blog post](https://medium.com/build-addepar/es-classes-in-ember-js-63e948e9d78e)
  for more information.
- Template-only components that do not have a wrapping `<div>` - can be enabled
  as an [optional feature](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-optional-features).

Eventually it will be possible to seamlessly use Glimmer.js components in
Ember.js applications (see the
[quest issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16301) for more
information). That will also enable _"upgrading"_ Glimmer.js applications to
Ember.js once they reach a certain size and complexity and the additional
features and concepts that Ember.js provides over Glimmer.js justify a more
heavyweight framework.

## Testing

Glimmer.js' testing APIs are very similar to what Ember.js uses for
[component tests](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/testing/testing-components/).
The idea is to render a particular component with a given set of properties and
attributes and assert on the generated DOM:

```js
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import hbs from '@glimmer/inline-precompile';
import { setupRenderingTest } from '@glimmer/test-helpers';

module('Component: MeasurementRow', function(hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);

  test('PPM Case', async function(assert) {
    await this.render(hbs`
      <MeasurementRow
        @value="12"
        @parameter="pm25"
        @unit="ppm"
      />
    `);
    let label = this.containerElement.querySelector('[data-test-measurement-label]').textContent.trim();
    let value = this.containerElement.querySelector('[data-test-measurement-value]').textContent.trim();
    let unit = this.containerElement.querySelector('[data-test-measurement-unit]').textContent.trim();

    assert.equal(label, 'PM25', 'Parameter is rendered');
    assert.equal(value, '12', 'Value is rendered');
    assert.equal(unit, 'ppm', 'Unit is rendered');
  });
});
```

This test case tests the `MeasurementRow` component by passing a set of
properties and asserting that the DOM contains the expected elements with the
expected content. The key element to notice is the invocation of
`setupRenderingTest` which sets the test case up as a rendering test. Rendering
tests have a `render` method that takes a template and renders that into the
testing container. The rendered component's root element can then be accessed
via the test's `containerElement` property.

We use `data-test-` attributes in this test to select elements in the DOM (e.g.
`this.containerElement.querySelector('[data-test-measurement-label]')`). That
allows using expressive selectors in tests without relying on DOM structure or
CSS class names. As these attributes are only needed for testing, we strip them
from the templates in production builds so that we don't grow the bundle size
unnecessarily. For a full-featured addon that makes that approach conveniently
available for Ember.js applications, check out
[the `ember-test-selectors` addon](https://ember-test-selectors.com).

Glimmer.js' testing APIs still have some shortcomings (see
[this issue](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/issues/14)) and are not
entirely ready for prime time. In order to test some more advanced component
behaviors, we use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) to run the entire application
in a headless browser.

## Outlook

In future posts, we will look at some specific aspects of the application in
more detail, including service workers and offline functionality (and testing
that with Puppeteer), server side rendering (which enables progressive
enhancement where JavaScript is not even needed in the browser anymore to be
able to use the application) and how we optimized the app's CSS using
[css-blocks](http://css-blocks.com).

Stay tuned 👋

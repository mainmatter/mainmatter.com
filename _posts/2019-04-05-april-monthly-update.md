## News

#### Florian Pichler joins simplabs

We're very excited to announce that [Florian Pichler](https://twitter.com/pichfl/) has joined simplabs.

Florian’s career has varied from user interfaces and print design to frontend development but what ties his entire career together is a strong focus on user experience.

He has a wealth of experience doing consulting work around new technologies and both native and web-based apps. In this work he has helped to shape, design and bring to life projects for Audi, BMW, Microsoft, Zurich Insurance Group and many more.

Florian also speaks at events about design and development and is also a maintainer for [BookPlayer](https://github.com/TortugaPower/BookPlayer), a free and open source iOS app for audiobooks.

Our CEO Marco says _"I'm very happy to have Florian on board. His expertise in both the engineering and design fields as well as experience working with big corporate clients make him a valuable addition to the team and will allow us to bring more value to simplabs clients in the future."_

[EmberConf 2019](https://emberconf.com/) in Portland starts on March 18th and
we're proud to be sponsoring the event. We'll also be taking some members of
the team along.

Ricardo Mendes will host a
[Contributors Workshop](https://emberconf.com/schedule.html#contributors-workshop)
along with [Jen Weber](https://twitter.com/jwwweber).

Also, [Jessica Jordan](https://twitter.com/jjordan_dev) will be giving a talk
about
[Crafting Web Comics in Ember](https://emberconf.com/speakers.html#jessica-jordan)
which promises to be a very fun and informative talk.

Lastly, [Chris Manson](https://twitter.com/real_ate) will be giving a lightning
talk about [empress-blog](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog).

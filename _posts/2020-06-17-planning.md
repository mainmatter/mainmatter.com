Planning digital product projects is hard and many teams struggle very hard with
it. There are various stakeholders, each with different requirements and
interests that often seem to contradict each other. Management is interested in
in knowing how long an initiative will take and what the final budget will be.
Marketing teams might have to schedule campaigns and book media outlets for
selling a product and thus have to know when it will be ready. Product and
business experts usually cannot know what the final shape of a product will be
unless they have something they can show to users, get feedback on and adapt
their vision to actually build something that will deliver the value users are
looking for. Lastly, engineering teams struggle to give reliable estimates as
they simply cannot oversee all of an initiative's hidden complexities,
dependencies and consequences upfront.

In this post, I will analyze a number of typical problems many teams struggle
with. I will also present techniques that we at simplabs have developed to
overcome those struggles and reduce uncertainty, risk and frustration in product
teams.

## The Macro Level

When it comes to planning software projects, there's two extremes â€“ trying to
plan everything up-front or accepting the impossibility of getting that right
anyway and not bothering planning anything. While most teams will find
themselves somewhere in the middle between those two, it's still worth reviewing
them first.

### Over-planning

Historically, in a [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
based world, this technique was widely used. The idea is to plan the entirety of
the project up-front in much detail, projecting that plan on to a timeline and
then executing it. Teams following that approach would write long and detailed
specifications that describe all aspects of the project. They would then break
that specification down into a backlog of smaller tasks and assign effort
estimates to those (using e.g.
[story points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker)). Based on
previously acquired knowledge about how much work a team can get done in a
defined time (it's
["velocity"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(software_development)>)),
the next step is to extrapolate how long the project will take â€“ _"We can build
the social network for elephants as described in the 587 page long specification
in 67 weeks and it will cose 1.34 Mio. â‚¬"_.

Obviously this never works, deadlines will be missed and budgets will overrun.

### Under-planning

The opposite of that approach is doing no or only very little up-front planning
and just running off. While that removes a lot of pressure from development
teams (designers and engineers), other stakeholders that have legitimate needs
with regards to predictability and simply insight into a project's progress are
left in the dark. The marketing team will not know when to book the billboards
in the local zoo and the product experts can't set up the user testing session
with a team of sample elephants as they don't know what features they would be
able to test when and whether there would be a coherent set of functionality
ready to use at any time at all.

### An incremental approach doesn't magically fix things

As stated above, no teams (that I have seen at least ðŸ¤ž) in reality strictly
follow any of these approaches. The classic waterfall model fortunately is a
thing of the past now and the shortcomings of having a team just run off with no
plan are too obvious for anyone being brave (or stupid) enough to try it. In
fact, developing products iteratively starting with an MVP and incrementally
improving that is a widely accepted technique now. That way, the scope and thus
complexity and risk is significantly reduced and each increment would be broken
down again into iterations (often referred to as
["sprint"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint>)
â€“ which I think is a horrible term but that's a blog post of its own right) so
that the scope is reduced further into something much more manageable.

However, in reality simply adopting an iterative process (whether that's
[Scrum]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development), a team's
own interpretation of it or something completely different) will in reality not
magically solve all of the above problems. Teams will still face budget
overruns, an inability to give reliable estimates even given the short time
horizon of a two week iteration. Unforeseen and unplanned-for complexities and
challenges will still only be uncovered only after a task was started, many
tasks will span multiple sprints unexpectedly and already completed features
will regularly have to be revisited and changed even before launching the MVP.
Also, projecting a team's velocity over the entire backlog to calculate a
timeline for the entire project will usually result in completely unreliable and
made-up numbers.

Having moved planning from the macro level where it did reside with the classic
waterfall approach to the micro level of an iteration, that's also were the
problems are now.

## The Micro Level

Planning on the micro level of an iteration means scoping, bundling and
estimating concrete, actionable units of work. There are countless names for
those which also depend on the particular process and tool in use but in reality
it doesn't matter whether you call them issues, (user) stories or TODOs, whether
you organize them in trees with several levels of subtasks and/or overarching
epics â€“ what they are is tasks that one or several team members can work on and
complete, ideally in relatively short time (like a few days at most). A bundle
of tasks defines the scope of an iteration which in turn is what we're planning
on the micro level.

### Isn't a plan just a guess anyway?

There's a very popular quote from the team behind Basecamp, a bootstrapped
company that built a hugely successful project management SaaS with the same
name:

_"Planning is guessing."_

Basecamp explain the idea in more detail in their bestselling book
[_"Rework"_](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) That quote is both great and
widely mis-understood. What it means is that anything beyond a pretty small
scope is inherently not planable and any plan anyone makes up for it, is
essentially nothing more than a guess. As explained above that is very much true
at the macro level where scope and complexity are way too big for anyone to be
able to fully understand all aspects of a project in sufficient detail to
develop a reliable plan. What the quote does not mean however, is that you can
never do any planning when the scope is limited â€“ which is the fact on the micro
level of an iteration.

Yet, many project teams use _"planning is guessing"_ as an excuse to refuse to
doing any up-front analysis or preparation of tasks at all. Even experienced and
otherwise senior engineers will sometimes refer to their creative energy and
freedom that could be disturbed or even destroyed by thorough preparation. While
it is true of course that understanding any task fully and in its entirety
usually requires working on and in fact completing the task, it is very well
possible to analyze it to uncover hidden complexity, dependencies and
implications â€“ not only from an engineering perspective but also from the
perspectives of other stakeholders like design, product, marketing etc.

Doing so will help understanding the scope of a particular task, identifying
dependent work that needs to be done before or in consequence or breaking down a
task into smaller subtasks that can be done in parallel or maybe release
independently as incremental improvements. All that reduces the uncertainty that
is associated with the task and even while you won't be able to fully eliminate
all uncertainty, eliminating a big part or maybe most of it significantly
improves the reliability of estimates and minimizes unplanned work that is
usually necessary when running into unforeseen complications only after work has
started.

## ~Planning~ Preparation

In order to improve planning on the micro level, it is essential to conduct
thorough preparation. I will present three key techniques that are essential for
effective preparation of tasks and that simplabs has been practicing
successfully for years.

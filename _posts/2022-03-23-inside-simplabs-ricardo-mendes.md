Ricardo talks about the challenges and perks of joining a fully remote company.
They share how curiosity helped them become successful in their work field, and
also list a few people from different open source communities that have been
inspiring them through the years.

Ricardo is very active in open source, but when they are not busy working on
code, they enjoy playing airsoft, reading books, and making music.

In Inside simplabs, we take you behind the scenes and interview our team
members. They share valuable insights on their jobs as well as their personal
interests, hobbies, and goals.

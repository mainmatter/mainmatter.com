Following on from last week's premiere in Amsterdam the new [HoneyPot](https://www.honeypot.io/) film **'Ember: A Mini Documentary'** will be shown in Berlin this evening (2019-02-11).

The film is a deep dive into the world of Ember.js and includes an interview with our CEO Marco Otte-Witte. After the screening Jessica Jordan from simplabs will present '**Everything They Didn't Tell You About the Ember Community'** which will be followed by a Q&A.

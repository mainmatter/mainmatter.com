Could some adjustments to kick-off meetings lead to a more streamlined and efficient collaboration?
<!--break-->

## Kick-off Meetings
At simplabs, we believe in working alongside clients throughout projects as a way to get better outcomes, but because we aim to build relationships rather than just projects.

Kick-off meetings are one of the first things we tackle as part of our process to deliver digital products. We use them to launch the project and bring the client on board.

I want to present an approach to kick-off meetings that can spark collaboration early in the project and create common ground between all project stakeholders. This approach focuses on creating a mindset that is distinctly different from the typical frame with which most software projects are conducted.

That typical frame looks something like this:

1. Introductions
2. Client Background
3. Project Goals
4. Scope of Project
5. Approach
6. Roles and Responsibilities

### Kick-Off Meetings Are More Than Just Checklists

To be clear, I think those are good points to cover, however, treating this as a
checklist won't produce any lasting impact on participants. An intentional facilitated approach is
required to make these points come to life and spark real and honest discussion,
as well as to work through conflict.

## Team Introductions Can Serve as a Way to Communicate Organizational and Team Culture 

![Team Stages](/assets/images/posts/2020-04-27-facilitate-client-onboarding/team-stages.png)

Most teams undergo a gradual process before they can reach peak performance. In
the initial forming stage there is a mix of emotions, ranging from excitement to
anxiety. Good introductions can help teams develop stronger bonds much faster.

### Introductions are more about culture than individual people

Most teams undergo a gradual process before they can reach peak performance. In the initial forming stage there is a mix of emotions, ranging from excitement to anxiety. The same principle applies to team and client interactions, and in this case, introductions can serve as culture carriers. 

A strong notion of the shared culture of a team will influence interactions with the client and stakeholders. What is left unsaid, risks being filled with assumptions, unwritten rules, and pre-existing attitudes towards certain things. So, how can those invisible parts become visible during an introduction? Next time you introduce yourself, make a conscious decision to share your expectations, what you like, and dislike, dare to be more personal.

#### Example:

"Hello, my name is [Name], and I will be **working with you** on the design
aspects of this project. I've read your brief, and I find **challenges like
yours fascinating** from a design perspective, especially when it comes to users
creating value for others. I hope to **learn more from your vision** throughout
this project and know that I am always open to discuss things briefly, even if
unrelated to the project, feel free to **send an email if you have any
questions**."

By being intentional about the introduction, we can communicate additional
layers of behaviors we like, how people can address us, what we expect from
them, and what we bring to the table beside our work.

## Helping the Client Describe Their Journey Through Active Listening

The kick-off meeting marks the moment where a client hands-off their idea to the team that will build and implement it. It is a pivotal time in a project, and it's crucial to hear the client's project journey with as much detail as possible.

If we consider that the client has been exposed to their idea for much longer than the team, then it's likely that the recency effect has them detach from the historical details of their journey and give more weight to recent events instead. However, there are things we can do to overcome this and turn the project introduction into a learning opportunity.

### Actively Listen and Delay Judgement

![SCARF MODEL](/assets/images/posts/2020-04-27-facilitate-client-onboarding/scarf.png)

It is not hard to find incongruencies or faults when someone is presenting an idea, even more so if it's the first time we are exposed to it. We can help the client connect and provide all the details if we take an active listener position and delay offering suggestions or advice. It is even better if we can ask questions that lead them to be more critical of their assumptions.

The SCARF model from the domain of neuroscience provides a framework to understand the common factors leading to threat responses and how we can change directions to more collaborative win-win scenarios. It helps to explain why active listening is so effective. We all thrive when we are learning and improving, and when attention is being paid to our efforts. This activity can produce a state of willingness to do difficult things, to take risks, and try new solutions.

## How do we discuss project goals?

![An infamous example of the danger groupthink to team learning can be found in the events leading up to the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986](/assets/images/posts/2020-04-27-facilitate-client-onboarding/challenger.png)

Project goals usually develop into conflict at later stages of the project, and
when that happens, we are generally so far into the project that the cost of
change is too high to act on them. In an ideal scenario, we'd challenge those
goals through the perspective of all the disciplines present at the meeting
(e.g., product, design, technology, and business). However, if groupthink takes
place, we might fall into our desire for harmony and conformity and avoid
critical reasoning or evaluation.

### Debating our way out of groupthink

The encouragement of debate can undoubtedly help a team move past groupthink.
Project disasters often result from a team's failure to sense the severity of
problems, ask questions, and surface conflict in a timely fashion. A group that
can tolerate ambiguity and a state of not knowing is better equipped to avoid
and recognize factors that cause projects to fail.

### The circle of influence

The circle of influence is a great way to generate debate and surface concerns
around project goals and outcomes. By collaboratively categorizing the project
goals and outcomes into the concern, influence, and control spheres, we can
focus our energy on the things we can change and start identifying the biggest
threats, even those outside of our control. As a group, we can now share
ownership over the outcomes in a way that doesn't threaten the emotional safety
of each team member.

## Next Steps

The facilitator role should continue to be present during the rest of the
project. However, a good start will help everyone handle uncertainty and
conflict a lot better, especially during the hardest parts, but also to
celebrate the shared achievements.

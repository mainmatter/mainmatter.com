This article details a technique where the visual testing software
[Percy](https://percy.io/) was used to port the old
[Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) to an entirely different
technology, without anybody noticing.

## Motivation

This was one of the first steps in the long road to _Emberify_ and redesign the
Ember website by first converting the architecture away from an old (and hard to
maintain) Ruby middleman app, to a modern Static Single Page Application that is
a dream to contribute to! This technique was first used to convert the
[Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com) to an Ember app and was then later
used to convert the main [Ember Website](https://emberjs.com).

The technique described below is a slightly novel way of using Percy, instead of
tracking changes over the course of an active project we are using Percy to
bootstrap our migration effort and make sure our ported app looks the same when
it is done.

## Strict Requirements

The point of this project was to change the technology that powered the Ember
Guides without altering the look or feel of the site for end users. There were
many factors that we needed to consider, but this post only looking at the
design.

We decided early on that we would not accept any functionality changes or minor
design improvements as part of this project, in an effort to keep the initial
project scope as small as possible and to improve the likelihood that we would
ship the end product in a reasonable timeframe. While we weren't opposed to
improving the end-user experience for this application, our objective was to
make it **easier** to contribute improvements to the Ember Guides application.
With this in mind we decided to release the technology re-write first, without
noticeably changing anything! This allowed us to have a straightforward
requirement: **if it looks the same we can ship it.**

## Enter Percy, stage right

I had heard a lot about [Percy](https://percy.io/) over the years, being a part
of the Ember community! It's a great product and something that is well-aligned
philosophically with Ember. If you have ever had the pleasure to use Percy you
will know that it has had a lot of thought put into it and it Just Works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è when
you start working with it.

For those of you who don't know what Percy is, on their website they describe
themselves as "Your all-in-one visual review platform". Just like Code Reviews
and Pull requests, Percy allows you to view any **visual changes** as a result
of the work that you are doing on an application. I have also heard it referred
to as a "visual regression test system", but in practice it is much more than
that. üòÇ

This got me thinking; if you can use Percy for visual regression tests, then why
can't you use it to do an overarching regression test for porting the technology
powering your website, sort of like a "migration regression test". After a bit
of experimentation that is what we decided to do.

## Setting up the baseline

The first time you run Percy it takes a snapshot of all pages on your site and
uses these as the "baseline" for which any subsequent change needs to be
compared against.

Note: Percy doesn't always take a snapshot of your entire site; it depends on
how you integrate their SDKs with your application. For the purpose of this
article (and during the guides migration) we are using the "static site" command
line interface to upload to Percy, which loops through all of your html files
and effectively uploads snapshots for all pages of your site.

Once you have this baseline loaded for your "master" branch, you can setup Percy
in your Continuous Integration (CI) service so that every Pull Request (PR) you
make will be **compared against the baseline** and you will see a visual diff of
what the site used to look like against the current changes.

![An example of the Percy interface](/assets/images/posts/2020-03-27-porting-a-site-to-ember-with-percy/percy-example.png#@920-1920)

### Getting a copy of the existing site

The first thing that we need in this process is a local copy of the existing
site we are planning to port. If you look at the
[documentation for using the Percy command line client](https://docs.percy.io/docs/command-line-client)
it tells you that you should build your static site locally and then point the
CLI client to the output folder.

As I briefly mentioned earlier, part of the issue with the old infrastructure
for the Ember Guides was that it was so hard to contribute to that it was almost
impossible to get working locally. If we can avoid having to run the Ruby
middleman setup locally, that would be a better approach, so another way to get
a static copy of the website would be to pretend that we're Google for a few
minutes and just crawl the site to download it locally.

If you are on a Linux machine you probably have `wget` installed, it is a
particularly useful tool to download single files quickly and easily. If you are
on macOS then you will probably need to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to
install it:

```bash
brew install wget
```

Before working on this project I didn't actually realise that, not only can you
use `wget` to download single files but you can also use it to crawl and
download entire websites! Here is the command that I'm using to download the
entire [Ember Website](https://emberjs.com):

```bash
wget --recursive \
     --page-requisites \
     --html-extension \
     --convert-links \
     --domains emberjs.com \
     emberjs.com
```

Note: I'm running these commands on macOS with `wget` version _1.19.5_ so you
might need to confirm these arguments for your platform and `wget` version.

If you Google "crawl website with wget" or "download entire site with wget" you
will undoubtedly get quite a few variations of the above set of arguments to the
`wget` command. Most of these arguments are self-explanatory (and it could be an
exercise for you to check the wget man page to see exactly what they do) but if
you are planning to run this on your own site I would recommend using the
`--domains` option, and you might want to also look into `--reject-regex`.

When crawling sites with something like `wget` things can very quickly get out
of hand. If your site has external links to other domains and you don't limit
the domains you want to download with `--domains` you can very quickly end up
downloading the whole internet!

`--reject-regex` is also a useful tool if you have some subfolders that have
dynamically generated content. When we first ran this command on the Ember
website the blog was available at https://emberjs.com/blog and had 220+ pages
that would be downloaded in our crawl. üò¨ Adding the following line to our
`wget` command would have excluded that whole directory

```
--reject-regex '/blog/*'
```

### Verifying all the pages are there

After running the above command we have a folder `emberjs.com` that contains a
static copy of the Ember Website. We now need to list all of the pages and make
sure that we're happy that we've captured all of the necessary pages.

Thankfully we used `--html-extension` which will make sure that all html files
end with `.html` so we can run a simple `find` command in that folder to list
the pages:

```bash
find . -iname '*.html'
```

You should now go through and prune any html files that you don't want to use
and make sure that everything you expect to be there is. In our case it was
listing quite a few "query param" pages that we really didn't care about so we
just needed to delete them.

```
./mascots?filter=zoey.html
./mascots?filter=other.html
./mascots?filter=tomster.html
./mascots?filter=corp.html
./mascots?filter=meetup.html
./mascots?filter=conference.html
```

If you have access to the output directory of the application that you're trying
to migrate then you won't need to go through this step of cleaning up so I would
recommend that if you can.

### Uploading to Percy

It is worth referring to the instructions
https://docs.percy.io/docs/command-line-client but for us we are running the
following command:

```bash
PERCY_TOKEN=not_our_real_token PERCY_BRANCH=master percy snapshot emberjs.com
```

In this example emberjs.com is the name of the folder that was created with the
`wget` command. We need to provide the `PERCY_BRANCH` in our case because Percy
is supposed to be run in conjunction with your Version Control System (VCS) and
since we just have a folder instead of a git repository it won't autodetect our
branch. We want it to be our `master` branch because this is going to serve as
the baseline around which all of the rest of the application will be built.

## Setting up Percy for the Ember Application

The
[official documentation for the Percy Ember integration](https://docs.percy.io/docs/ember)
is fantastic and I would **highly** recommend that you check it out. We need to
set up a very slightly custom implementation for our needs because we would like
the snapshots that were generated from the Percy CLI to match the snapshots from
the ember application. The simplest way to do this is for us to define the
mapping manually, here is what that mapping looks like in the ember-website
testing code:

```javascript
// This is used to map the current **new** routes to what they used to be in the
// old ruby app. This is to allow us to compare what the new app looks like
// vs the old app.
const pages = [
  { title: '/builds/index.html', route: '/releases' },
  { title: '/builds/beta/index.html', route: '/releases/beta' },
  { title: '/builds/canary/index.html', route: '/releases/canary' },
  { title: '/builds/release/index.html', route: '/releases/release' },
  { title: '/community/index.html', route: '/community/' },
  {
    title: '/community/meetups-getting-started.html',
    route: '/community/meetups-getting-started/',
  },
  { title: '/community/meetups.html', route: '/community/meetups/' },
  {
    title: '/ember-community-survey-2019.html',
    route: '/ember-community-survey-2019/',
  },
  { title: '/ember-users.html', route: '/ember-users/' },
  { title: '/guidelines.html', route: '/guidelines/' },
  { title: '/index.html', route: '/' },
  { title: '/learn.html', route: '/learn/' },
  { title: '/legal.html', route: '/about/legal/' },
  { title: '/logos.html', route: '/logos/' },
  { title: '/mascots.html', route: '/mascots/' },
  { title: '/meetup-assets.html', route: '/community/meetups/assets/' },
  { title: '/security.html', route: '/security/' },
  { title: '/sponsors.html', route: '/sponsors/' },
  { title: '/statusboard.html', route: '/statusboard' },
  { title: '/team.html', route: '/team/' },
  { title: '/tomster.html', route: '/mascots/' },
  { title: '/tomster/commission/index.html', route: '/mascots/commission/' },
  { title: '/tomster/faq.html', route: '/mascots/faq/' },
];
```

With this defined all we need to do is to loop through this array in an Ember
Acceptance test, use the `visit()` API to navigate to the specified route and
then use the Percy Ember testing API to take a snapshot. It's important to pass
the title into the snapshot so that we can match against the legacy application.

Here is what that code looks like in the ember-website:

```javascript
for (let config of pages) {
  await visit(config.route);
  await percySnapshot(config.title);
}
```

Even though I've copied most of the implementation into this post you can
[see it all in action directly in the source code of the ember-website project](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/blob/401a638dbb65191d1273de8336525bf9df6b53bc/tests/acceptance/visual-regression-test.js#L1)

## Open a PR, Iterate on the design, Ship when green

At this point, it's time to open a PR to test your Percy integration. This will
create a Percy build that will be a comparison to the baseline that we set up
previously. **Note:** it's important to do this in a PR and not on your `master`
branch directly because Percy will automatically "approve" changes that are
pushed to your master branch. Once you open the PR, if you have followed the
Percy installation instructions correctly, Percy will start to build your visual
diff.

The examples shown in this post have been leading up to
[an actual PR on the ember-website project](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/185)
and you will see in the CI checks for that PR that the initial Percy build is
failing. If you saw the visual diff you would have seen that there was quite
some work that needed to be done before this was ready to go live, but I never
said that this would do all the work for you! üòÇ

What Percy is really giving you here is the confidence to know when the project
is ready to be shipped. If you can constrain the requirements to "make it look
like it did before", and you can avoid "feature creep", then you will know with
confidence that it is ready to deploy when you have a passing CI and your Percy
build shows no changes. If Percy is happy then you can deploy with confidence.

## Summary

This is a useful technique that we have now used successfully twice to port
large projects from Ruby middleman to Ember in the Ember Learning Team, and
while it is not exactly using Percy as it was designed, it is a very useful
technique to have in your tool belt.

If you have a project that you are thinking of porting to EmberJS and would like
to discuss it with us, or if you have any general questions about this topic we
encourage you to [contact us](https://simplabs.com/contact/)!

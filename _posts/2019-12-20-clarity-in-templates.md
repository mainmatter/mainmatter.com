When reading Ember templates, have you ever wondered where a certain dynamic value comes from? Is that dynamic value a property of the component, a named argument that was passed in, or even a helper?

In this blog post we will be discussing how recent Ember.js modernization efforts on the path to Ember Octane have brought features that help with this exact problem.

## Ember Octane and editions

As a framework that values stability and providing its users solid upgrade paths, Ember has accrued its fair share of idiosyncrasies. One of the more demonstrable consequences of this is the so called pit of incoherence, alluded to in the [opening keynote of EmberConf 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwdBcmz6VI): APIs are introduced that move the framework to a new mental model, but that mental model isn't complete yet. This leaves users unsure of which APIs to use when, and how the interop might work.

This is where editions come into play. The main goal of editions is to document and present a new and coherent mental model that developers can adhere to, while keeping compatibility with existing APIs. This is done in one of two ways, either a new API that can coexist with existing ones is introduced, or an optional feature that users can opt into is introduced. This allows for new applications to have the optional features and default blueprints of the newer editions, while existing applications can update their codebase at their own pace.

In this blog post we will address some changes to templates that were introduced with Ember Octane in mind, the first planned edition for the Ember.js framework. You can read more about Octane in the [official edition page](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane)].

## Ambiguity

In Ember templates, interpolation of dynamic values is done through curly braces, `{{}}`. Given this is the only syntax for dynamic values, there is an ambiguity problem at times. Let us look at a template:

```hbs
{{! app/templates/components/blog/post.hbs }}
<h1>{{title}}</h1>

{{post-body post=post}}

<button {{action 'expandComments'}}>

{{#if commentsExpanded}}
  {{#each post.comments as |commentObject|}}
    {{comment comment=commentObject onReport=onReportComment
    }}
  {{/each}}
{{/if}}
```

Looking only at the template, can we be certain where `title` comes from? Whether `post-body` and `comment` are helpers or components? We can generously assume that `comment` is a component as it is receiving an action, but when scanning the file it is indistinguishable from `if`, `each`, and other templating constructs.

We will work step by step to remove ambiguity where we can.

### Disambiguating properties

We will start by marking which dynamic values come from the component's JavaScript. These are called properties. To do that we are going to consult the JavaScript file to see which properties it might define:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { computed } from '@ember/object';
import titleCase from 'my-app/utils/title-case.js';

export default Component.extend({
  title: computed('post.title', function() {
    return titleCase(this.post.title);
  }),

  commentsExpanded: false,

  actions: {
    toggleComments() {
      this.toggleProperty('commentsExpanded');
    },
  },
});
```

We see that `title` is a computed property, and `commentsExpanded` is a boolean defined in the class definition, so we will update the template accordingly:

```hbs
{{! app/templates/components/blog/post.hbs }}
<h1>{{this.title}}</h1>

{{post-body post=post}}

<button {{action 'expandComments'}}>

{{#if this.commentsExpanded}}
  {{#each post.comments as |commentObject|}}
    {{comment comment=commentObject onReport=onReportComment
    }}
  {{/each}}
{{/if}}
```

The great thing about this feature is that all versions of Ember support it, so you can start annotating properties in your templates today. You can also enforce that no new implicit `this` are added to templates by configuring the appropriate [`ember-template-lint`](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint) rule.

### Disambiguating named arguments

Next we will turn our attention to named arguments. We give this name to values that we pass into components when we use them. Since components do not have access to the context where they are called in, this is the primary way to pass information into them.

To see what we are passing into our `blog/post` component, we need to see how it is used in our application. To do this, we will check a route template, namely the template for the `blog` route, where the component is used:

```hbs
{{! app/templates/blog.hbs }}
{{blog/post post=post onReportComment=(action 'onReportComment')}}
```

We can see that when calling the component, we are passing in `post` and `onReportComment`. The syntax to mark them as named argument is a `@` prefix, so let us update our template:

```hbs
{{! app/templates/components/blog/post.hbs }}
<h1>{{this.title}}</h1>

{{post-body post=@post}}

<button {{action 'expandComments'}}>

{{#if this.commentsExpanded}}
  {{#each post.comments as |commentObject|}}
    {{comment comment=commentObject onReport=@onReportComment
    }}
  {{/each}}
{{/if}}
```

We have improved our template a further step, now we can tell properties and named arguments apart. Next we will dive into component invocation.

If you wish to use named arguments in your application, you can use [`ember-named-arguments-polyfill`](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-named-arguments-polyfill) for Ember.js versions older than 3.1.

Named arguments mostly apply to components, since they are the piece of Ember that is explicitly invoked by developers unlike route templates which the framework renders for you.

Note that `@model` was introduced by [RFC #523 "Model Argument for Route Templates"](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0523-model-argument-for-route-templates.html) so that you can refer directly to the model that was passed to a route template.

### Disambiguating components

After the last change, it would be nice to have a way to disambiguate component invocations from other kinds of dynamic interpolations. Fortunately, a new syntax was introduced by [RFC #311 "Angle Bracket Invocation"](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.html), that allows us to do just that. Using angle bracket invocation also enables us to distinguish between named arguments passed to the component, and HTML attributes passed to the component. HTML attributes and `...attributes` will be covered in a future post.

To update, we replace curly braces with an HTML-like `<>` syntax–hence angle bracket invocation,–using capital case for the name of the component, `::` instead of `/` for nested components, and prefixing named arguments with `@`. Here is how the above `blog` and `blog/post` templates look like once updated:

```hbs
{{! app/templates/blog.hbs }}
<Blog::Post @post={{post} @onReportComment={{action 'onReportComment'}} />
```

```hbs
{{! app/templates/components/blog/post.hbs }}
<h1>{{this.title}}</h1>

<PostBody @post={{@post}} />

<button {{action 'expandComments'}}>

{{#if this.commentsExpanded}}
  {{#each post.comments as |commentObject|}}
    <Comment @comment={{commentObject}} onReport={{@onReportComment
    }} />
  {{/each}}
{{/if}}
```

To use this feature in older versions of Ember and its dependencies, you can use [`ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfilll`](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill).

With just a couple of tweaks, we now have much more clarity when reading a template, and the need to consult additional files is lessened:

- `{{this.title}}` is a property that comes from the JavaScript file of the component;
- `<PostBody />` is a component invocation;
- `{{@post}}` is a named argument that is passed to the component when invoked;
- `{{this.commentsExpanded}}` is also a property;
- `if` and `each` are templating constructs
- `commentObject` is a block argument that is available inside the `each` block scope
- `<Comment />` is a component invocation

These were not the only improvements made to Ember's templating engine, or even to components. Also introduced to the framework were the ability to pass HTML attributes to components and apply them with `...attributes`, a simplification of DOM event handling with the [`on`](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0471-on-modifier.html) and [`fn`](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0470-fn-helper.html) modifiers replacing `action`, the ability for users to create [custom element modifiers](https://github.com/ember-modifier/ember-modifier) like the built-in `action`, `on`, and `fn`, [rendering lifecycle element modifiers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-render-modifiers), and [Glimmer components](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0416-glimmer-components.html).

These new features will be covered in upcoming posts, so be sure to keep an eye out for them!

A component playground is an application that you can use to test out and
play around with your custom components in isolation from the rest of your
project. In the React and Vue ecosystem [Storybook][storybook] is a quite popular project
that implements such a component playground as part of your app. In the Ember
ecosystem we have the [`ember-freestyle`][ember-freestyle] addon that can be
used for this purpose. This blog post will show you how to install
`ember-freestyle` in your app and how to use it to build and test components
in isolation.

## Component Playgrounds

You might be wondering "Why would would I need something like this? I can just
test my components in the app!" and you're right. But imagine building a
reasonably large application with dozens of routes, hundreds of components
and thousands of possible component states. Checking all of these
component states manually on the different routes that they are appearing on
is a very time consuming task. A component playground solves this by allowing
you to display multiple component states next to each other on a single page
to give you a much better and quicker overview of how the component will look
like in the end.

Another big advantage of using component playgrounds is that it forces you to
build reusable components that are isolated from the app's business logic and
layout. That means they don't depend on any state or actions in your
controllers, routes and ideally services, but only on the data and action
handlers that are passed into them.

If you want to know more about why component playgrounds are useful in general
I recommend reading this great blog post ["UI component explorers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour new favorite tool"][ui-component-explorers]
by Dominic Nguyen that explains the benefits very well.

## Installing `ember-freestyle`

Installing and configuring `ember-freestyle` correctly is unfortunately a
little complicated right now so if you want to take a look at the final
outcome, you can skip forward to the ["Using `ember-freestyle`"](#using-ember-freestyle)
section for now.

Before we start installing anything we should make sure we know what situation
we would like to be in at the end. Our plan is to use `ember-freestyle` to
generate a component playground at the `/freestyle` route, that is only
available during development and does not affect the final asset sizes of the
production build.

Let's start by following the official instructions on the `ember-freestyle`
website:

- `ember install ember-freestyle`
- Add `this.route('freestyle');` to the `app/router.js` file

### Adjusting the `application` template

If you try this in a fresh new Ember app, run the development server using
`ember serve` and visit `http://localhost:4200/freestyle` you will notice the
first problem: The `ember-freestyle` components are appearing underneath the
`{{welcome-page}}` component:

![Screenshot](/assets/images/posts/2017-12-07-ember-freestyle/freestyle-underneath-welcome-page.png)

This is obviously not what we want. To fix this we will need to adjust the
`app/templates/application.hbs` file and wrap the existing contents in a
condition:

```diff
+{{#if onFreestyleRoute}}
+  {{outlet}}
+{{else}}
 {{!-- The following component displays Ember's default welcome message. --}}
 {{welcome-page}}
 {{!-- Feel free to remove this! --}}

 {{outlet}}
+{{/if}}
```

`onFreestyleRoute` is a property on the `application` controller that will be
set to `true` once we visit the `/freestyle` route and and back to `false`
once we leave it again. This can be implemented in the `app/routes/freestyle.js`
file, and since that does not exist yet, we can generate it using
`ember generate route freestyle` (choose not to overwrite the existing
template!) and then adjusting it like this:

```js
export default Route.extend({
  activate() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    this.controllerFor('application').set('onFreestyleRoute', true);
  },

  deactivate() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    this.controllerFor('application').set('onFreestyleRoute', false);
  },
});
```

If you check `/freestyle` again you should see that now the only thing that is
displayed is the `ember-freestyle` guide. üéâ

### Removing `ember-freestyle` from the production build

Once you try to ship this to production you might notice another issue: your
asset size has increased significantly, so it seems that `ember-freestyle` is
not disabled for production builds by default. Let's fix this!

According to the `ember-freestyle` documentation we are supposed to "blacklist"
the addon in the `ember-cli-build.js` file of our app:

```js
module.exports = function(defaults) {
  let environment = process.env.EMBER_ENV;
  let pluginsToBlacklist = environment === 'production' ? ['ember-freestyle'] : [];

  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    addons: {
      blacklist: pluginsToBlacklist,
    },
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```

Great! Now our asset size is back to normal. Wait... it is smaller now, but
still not quite back to what we had before. ü§î

The code above only removes all the components from the build that
`ember-freestyle` brings with it itself. That means components like
`{{freestyle-guide}}` and `{{freestyle-usage}}`
are no longer part of the production build, but the `freestyle` controller,
route and template are still included.

The solution to this problem is moving the `freestyle` files into a dedicated
`in-repo-addon` and then blacklisting that one too. First we generate a new
`in-repo-addon` using `ember generate in-repo-addon freestyle`. After that we
move `app/controllers/freestyle.js` to `lib/freestyle/app/controllers/freestyle.js`
and do the same for the `freestyle` route and template.

Next we will add our new `freestyle` in-repo-addon to the `pluginsToBlacklist`
list above:

```js
let pluginsToBlacklist = environment === 'production' ? ['ember-freestyle', 'freestyle'] : [];
```

Finally we need to adjust the paths that `ember-freestyle` uses to search for
the code snippets that show how the component is used in a host application.
For that we will add a `snippetSearchPaths` property in the `ember-cli-build.js`
file:

```js
let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  // ...
  freestyle: {
    snippetSearchPaths: ['lib/freestyle/app'],
  },
});
```

If you now restart the development server and check the `/freestyle` route
you should see that everything is working as before, but if instead you run
`ember serve -prod` you will notice that you only see a blank page because
the `freestyle` controller, route and template are no longer available.
If you would like to use your default 404 page instead you can put the
`this.route('freestyle');` call in the `router.js` file in a condition
that checks `if (config.environment === 'development')`.

This leaves us with only the single condition in the `application` template and
the `this.route('freestyle');` call in the `router.js` file that we ship to
production. While we could put in some effort to remove those too the situation
is good enough and we can finally focus on putting content into our new
component playground! üéâ

## Using `ember-freestyle`

The good news is that **using** `ember-freestyle` is much easier than setting
it up correctly!

Let's pretend we are writing a component called `styled-button`. We can create
a new file at `app/components/styled-button.js` and put the following content
in it:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend({
  tagName: 'button',
  classNames: ['styled-button'],
});
```

In addition to that we'll add some styles for this button to our
`app/styles/app.css` file:

```css
.styled-button {
  border: 1px solid #eee;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 3px 10px;
}
```

Finally we will add the button to our component playground by editing the
`lib/freestyle/app/templates/freestyle.hbs` template:

```handlebars
{{#freestyle-guide title='Ember Freestyle' subtitle='Living Style Guide'}}
  {{! ... }}

  {{#freestyle-section name='Components' as |section|}}
    {{#section.subsection name='styled-button'}}

      {{#freestyle-usage 'styled-button-example-1'}}
        {{#styled-button}}Hello World!{{/styled-button}}
      {{/freestyle-usage}}

      {{#freestyle-usage 'styled-button-example-2'}}
        {{#styled-button}}üòÄ üòé üëç üíØ{{/styled-button}}
      {{/freestyle-usage}}

    {{/section.subsection}}
  {{/freestyle-section}}
{{/freestyle-guide}}
```

If we now visit `http://localhost:4200/freestyle` we will see a new
"Components" section in the sidebar on the left that includes our
"styled-button" subsection. Once we click on that we will see our
`styled-button` usage examples including the snippets there were used to
display them:

![Screenshot](/assets/images/posts/2017-12-07-ember-freestyle/styled-button.png)

As this blog post has gotten much longer than intended already I'll leave it
up to your imagination what other things you can put into such a component
playground. In a follow-up post we will soon discuss how to extract subsections
into components and how to automatically discover and inject them into the main
template.

Finally I would like to thank [Chris LoPresto][chris-lopresto] and the other contributors for
working on `ember-freestyle` and would encourage you to give it a try!

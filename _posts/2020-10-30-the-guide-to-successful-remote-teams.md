Remote work has been a hot topic in the tech community for decades. While in the
late 90s and early 2000s, relatively few people were actually doing it and there
were quite some limitations to overcome to make it work at all. Today in 2020,
remote work is well possible in many industries and even the norm for many
companies already â€“ and of course the global pandemic that forced everyone to
work from home gave remote work an extra push. There are many more positive
reasons to adopt a remote working model than a potentially deadly virus though.
Employees get to choose where to live independently of where they work and save
a lot of time and money on sometimes long commutes (which is also great for the
climate â€“ with all the focus currently being on Covid 19 we must all not forget
about the real existential crisis humanity is facing after all). Companies also
benefit as they can attract talent from anywhere and are not limited in terms of
who they can hire by their location.

Yet, even as employees and companies alike are eager to adopt remote work and in
theory all the tools and infrastructure that is needed for it is available, it
is still not easy to get right. Many teams and companies are struggling
switching to a fully or partly remote working model and yearn for the return of
the days of the office. The reality is those days are not going to come back in
many industries though and making remote work a success is going to be one of
the key challenges many companies will be facing in the next years.

In this post, I want to share some insights we have gained by running simplabs
as a remote company since the beginning. In the early days, we've faced many of
the same challenges other teams are struggling with now. Over time, we overcame
each one though and learned a lot along the way. Today, we have team members in
six countries across Europe with people working from co-working offices in
Berlin, kitchens in Augsburg, sheds in Dublin or even from a sailboat in
Portugal. And we're not the only ones enjoying the many advantages of working
remotely â€“ 90% of remote workers say they plan to remain remote for the rest of
their career and 94% would even encourage others to work remotely as well
according to [a study](https://buffer.com/resources/state-remote-work-2018/)
that was conducted in 2018, so even before the pandemic.

## A remote culture

One of the key insights we gained is understanding that remote work is
fundamentally different from working in an office. Going remote cannot mean
mimicking the office and continuing to do the same things, just now remotely. It
requires sometimes substantially different practices when it comes to
collaboration and management and a lot of attention to aspects that are less
relevant when every team member works from the same room.

Possibly the single most important of these aspects is transparency and the flow
and sharing of information. People being out of the loop and not having access
to information that is relevant for their work, is probably the worst threat
remote teams face. While with everyone in the same office, diagrams, concepts or
calendars pinned to the wall (or the sticky-notes sprint board that has turned
into a status symbol for teams that "do agile" in the past years) are reasonable
and probably good tools for sharing information among people that all work from
the same location, for remote team members all of that information is completely
invisible. At the same time, the information is probably relevant for them and
not having access to it means they cannot do their job properly.

The need for transparency and equal access to information for all team members
is also the reason why even companies that only have a few or even only a single
team member work remotely must adopt a remote culture to make that a success.
When most of the team is still working from the same office, it is easy to
forget about the remote team members, still continue with the same practices as
before and only keep the remote people in the loop by sending them updates every
now and then or bringing them in to meetings occasionally. However, doing that
necessarily alienates the remote team members â€“ they lack transparency and
cannot participate in decision making processes â€“ or even if they are given the
opportunity to give their input and express opinions, they won't be able to do
so simply because they lack the necessary insight.

And while that does not mean all of a team always has to go fully remote at the
same time, adopting remote working practices is an allâ€“orâ€“nothing kind of change
starting with the first team member(s) that no longer work from the office.
While direct communication in the office is not something anyone should
prohibit, all the information and decisions that are made in these conversations
must be made transparent for the entire team. While writing summaries and
protocols or communicating via a chat tool although sitting at the desk next to
the person one is having a conversation with feels strange in the beginning, it
is a prerequisite for making remote work work at all. In that sense, the
pandemic that forced teams to go fully remote all at once at the same time might
even have made it easier rather than harder because everyone was feeling the
same pain and sharing the same perspective.

In the longer term, working remotely is not going to be for everyone though and
should not be something that is forced on people. Different people will be able
to adapt to remote work to different extents and not everyone will enjoy not
being surrounded by other people during the day. Out of personal experience, I
can say forcing parents with little kids and no dedicate office room to work
from home means a huge challenge for their entire families (as I'm sure many
people have experienced first hand during the international lockdowns). The
cultural change needs to be complete but that does not mean all of a team have
to work remote all of the time.

### Trust

Another important cultural aspect of switching to a fully or partly remote
working model is trust. Many managers' first reaction when faced with their
teams working remotely is asking

_"How can I know my team actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"_

Just because managers cannot **see** the work happening does not mean it does
not happen though. Managers' desire for micro-managing teams is an equally bad
habit regardless of whether the team is remote or not â€“ yet, remote teams seem
to increase that desire, often resulting in managers being on everyone's back
constantly and consistently. However, the occasional Slack message

TODO: convert this to image

> Hey ðŸ‘‹ How's it going? Project Manager is typingâ€¦ Just wanted to check where
> we are with feature x? Everything still on schedule?

is just as annoying on Slack as it is in real life. The reality is that remote
workers are likely more productive rather than less as they will find it easier
to focus and be less stressed according to a
[study from 2019](https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/Owl%20Labs%202019%20State%20of%20Remote%20Work%20Report%20PDF.pdf).
Building up that trust and giving people uninterrupted time to focus while
giving up on micro-management practices is a going to be a task for many
managers to learn over the next years.

## Infrastructure and tooling

Successfully working remotely requires adapting a number of infrastructure and tooling. Fortunately these tools have matured in the past few decades and many companies are even using some of them already. Which exact tools a team uses is not even so relevant and there are plenty of options available â€“ mostly those fall into three categories:

* tools for ad-hoc, realtime communication
* tools for knowledge management and sharing
* tools for organizing work and communicating status

- not too many tools
- Camera on, mute when you donâ€™t speak, use Headset
- Itâ€™s ok to block notifications
- When texting someone think about urgency, slack implies urgent, email not so
  much
- Remote is not slack and constant video calls, in fact thatâ€™s the worst form of
  remote
- Work wherever you want but make sure you have internet and can take calls

So in order to successfully adopt a new remote work model, all of the practices
and tooling a team uses have to be changed. The key point is to move all of the
information and communication which are the essence of successful team work to
be moved into the cloud so it is accessible independently of location. That
starts with moving information that teams used to have on whiteboards and sticky
note walls in the office into appropriate cloud based tools. It continues with
ensuring communication happens in ways that allows remote team members to join
in as well using tools like Slack. And while direct, face-to-face communication
is valuable and nothing anyone should ever try to deliberately block, make sure
outcomes of such communication are made available to the people that need access
to it, e.g. by posting a summary of it in the appropriate tool. Finally,
meetings must be held in ways that allow remote people to not only participate
but actively contribute to the conversation. Most often that means getting the
basics right so that decent audio and video quality is ensured. A meeting with 4
people in the same (large enough, and well aired) room with one of them joining
a video call from their notebook to allow a remote person to join is never going
to end up in a proper experience for them since they will usually barely be able
to follow the conversation, much less contribute to it. Appropriate conference
microphones and cameras go a long way and are negligible investments in
comparison to the loss of collaboration that is unpreventable if they are
lacking.

Besides hardware, software tooling obviously plays a key factor for a thriving
remote setup. There are mainly three different kinds of tooling remote digital
product development organizations need:

- Immediate Communication: tools like team chat and message boards enable ad-hoc
  communication and act as a replacement for the classic water cooler chat.
  While these tools are relevant and necessary though, it's critical to be aware
  they are essentially ephemeral in nature â€“ of course most of these tools do
  actually archive all communication so in theory it would be accessible later
  on, good luck finding a discussion on a particular topic that's scattered
  around different threads that happened on Slack a few days ago or a particular
  piece of information in an email thread from yesterday.
- Knowledge Management: these tools allow collaboratively creating, sharing and
  keeping relevant information. They are the remote equivalent of whiteboards
  and the place where feature descriptions or strategy documents would live.
  They must allow everyone to contribute to the information, have version
  tracking so people can understand who made what change and have a commenting
  functionality so teams can have conversations about the content.
- Work item tracking: tools that track individual work items are the main means
  of organizing work among remote teams and clearly communicate the status of
  each item to everyone. They are not mainly for tracking individual team
  members' progress and performance but help others to synchronize their
  potentially dependent work and identify blockers.

For all of the above categories, there are plenty of options available. While
all have their own pros and cons, picking a set of tools for any particular team
is mostly a matter of personal preference and there is no right or wrong choice.
What matters instead are a number of higher level points when introducing and
using any tools:

- Accessibility: tools being accessible to everyone who needs them might sound
  trivial but in reality is often a bigger issue than one might think. People
  are struggling with remembering URLs for tools, VPNs that many companies
  require are often unstable or hard to set up and keep working. Anyone who is
  not able to access a particular tool though is blocked from contributing their
  work.
- Availability: any set of tools a team might choose must also be available. The
  tools a team uses constitute the team's backbone and if they are not available
  for some reason, the team will be blocked from working. That means tools must
  be stable and not be offline but also fast and usable. While many companies
  desire to self-host everything in an effort to be on top of their
  infrastructure, in my experience that's often the worse choice and leads to
  friction and people being blocked â€“ unless you're a company that specializes
  in hosting these tools, you'll likely do a much worse job doing so than any
  third party provider you'd be to host things for you!
- Acceptance: in particular teams and companies that adopt remote work and the
  respective tools relatively new often struggle with a lack of acceptance of
  these tools among the team. People would still send each other emails or
  direct messages on Slack instead of publicly commenting relevant information
  on the respective tools so that the information would be available for the
  rest of the team as well. It is critical for everyone in remote teams to
  understand that this is not merely about their personal convenience but opting
  out of using the tools a team has agreed on means opting out of collaborating
  altogether and is harmful to the entire team!

## Distributed together

- 20% say they feel lonely https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020
  (during corona though)
- not for everyone and doesn't have to be for everyone, you can still have an
  office or coworking locations
- Separate work and private lives

Problems adapting their minds to remote work is not only something that team
members struggle with sometimes. It's also relatively widespread among
management. A common fear when adopting remote work is _"How can I know my team
actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"_ However, in my experience
that kind of thinking generally only reveals a lack of management competence and
trust. People are not likely to work less or worse only because they do not work
from a company-assigned location. If working from the office actually means they
would be observed and controlled closely by their management team, working
remotely would likely even result in an improvement of productivity since the
oversight is not something people would have to worry about anymore
(nevertheless their management should reconsider their practices). In fact,
increased productivity and better focus was among the top reasons that people
choose to work remotely according to a recent study
(https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/website/sorw/2020/owl-labs_sorw-2020_report-download_FINAL_07oct2020.pdf?).

What I see many managers, confronted with a suddenly remote team doing, is being
on everyone's back even more than they might be in the office. The occasional

> Hey ðŸ‘‹ How's it going? Project Manager is typingâ€¦ Just wanted to check where
> we are with feature x? Everything still on schedule?

is just as annoying on Slack as it is in real life and, which is much worse,
hugely interrupting. As said above, remote teams need to leverage cloud based
tools like issue trackers etc. and those are the tools where status and progress
is communicated.

With the freedom of remote work comes an increased demand for each team member's
ability to self-organize. While remote communication tools are great, taking
people by the hand remotely is harder than it might be in an office. People will
have to have a more proactive attitude, actively reach out for help or
information they need. The second important skill for anyone working remotely is
communication skills. While that seems counter-intuitive as it might seem remote
teams communicate **less** than teams with everyone in the same office, they
communicate differently and often even more. Instead of the random water cooler
chat, remote teams communicate a lot in written form using the tools discussed
above. Written communication is very different from direct verbal communication
though and it's harder to transport subtle meaning and detail and at the same
time it is easy to be misunderstood or (accidentally) offensive. A key ability
for anyone who wants to work remotely successfully, is the ability to express
themselves in writing.

Finally, when it comes to remote work, one concern is how teams can keep up
their team spirit and feeling of connection. After all, when everyone works from
a different location, you cannot go for lunch together, have an after-work beer
or the occasional round of Mario Kart in between work. Many people have
experienced that in their personal lives in the recent months and will continue
to do so in winter most likely. Virtual drinks are nice and all but the reality
is they cannot be a replacement for real-life, face-to-face interaction. A few
occasions every year where everyone comes together physically for a day or two
totally make up for the lack of physical connection for the rest of the year
though (when coming together, remember to take the train over flying though).

Besides that, there are plenty of other things you can and should do. Having a
weekly call with the entire team (or sub-team depending on the number of people)
where everyone gets to see each other (cameras on!) and talk for 30min or an
hour is invaluable for making sure people don't forget the faces and people
behind the screen names they interact with during work. Until we all are able to
have these kinds of events again though, there are plenty of alternatives like
remote board game sessions and even remote retreats!

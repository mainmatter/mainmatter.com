The ongoing and now, with the beginning of fall likely worsening, global
pandemic has forced companies worldwide to go fully or at least mostly remote.
While many companies and teams have been remote for quite some time, for many
this way of working is entirely new. And even if it comes with many challenges,
the benefits are manifold. Employees get to choose where to live independently
of where they find work and save a lot of time on sometimes long commutes (which
is also great for the environment and climate). In fact, 90% or remote workers
say they plan to remain remote for the rest of their career and 94% would even
encourage others to work remotely as well. Companies benefit as well as they can
attract talent from anywhere and are not limited in terms of who they can hire
by their location.

In the digital product development industry, remote work has been a widely
discussed topic for at least one or two decades. And while in the early 2000s,
it was relatively uncommon for teams to be entirely remote with processes and
tools not being quite there yet, in 2020 all of what's necessary to be fully
remote is there. Collaboration tools as well as audio and video conferencing
infrastructure have improved significantly and finally reached a level of
maturity that lives up to the expectations. Going remote is not merely a matter
of continuing to do the same things, just now remotely. That approach will
result in a lot of friction and frustration and likely not to a successful
transition. Besides following a number of guidelines, it is also essential to
conduct a cultural shift in how work is done.

simplabs has been full remote since it was founded. We have team members in six
countries across Europe now with people working from co-working offices in
Berlin, living rooms in Augsburg, sheds in Dublin or even a sailboat in
Portugal.

Going remote does not necessarily require shifting entire companies and teams to
the new working model at once. Also, different people will be able to adapt to
remote work to different extents. Out of personal experience, I can say forcing
parents with little kids and no dedicate office room to work from home means a
huge challenge for them (as I'm sure many people have experienced first hand
during the international lockdowns). However, despite not all of a company would
necessary have to go remote at the same time, what's important to understand is
that even only one team member going remote makes the entire organization a
remote organization.

Having parts of a team work remotely while continuing with the same work style
with everyone else immediately alienates the remote people and makes it harder
for them to do their job. All information that flows in the office in
desk-to-desk conversations etc. is invisible to the remote people. They will be
out of the loop on relevant decisions and won't have the information they need
to properly do their job. While that is negative for their productivity as they
will end up being blocked or moving in the wrong direction, it is also horrible
for their morale as they will feel alienated and no longer be an active and
appreciated member of the team.

So in order to successfully adopt a new remote work model, all of the practices
and tooling a team uses have to be changed. The key point is to move all of the
information and communication which are the essence of successful team work to
be moved into the cloud so it is accessible independently of location. That
starts with moving information that teams used to have on whiteboards and sticky
note walls in the office into appropriate cloud based tools. It continues with
ensuring communication happens in ways that allows remote team members to join
in as well using tools like Slack. And while direct, face-to-face communication
is valuable and nothing anyone should ever try to deliberately block, make sure
outcomes of such communication are made available to the people that need access
to it, e.g. by posting a summary of it in the appropriate tool. Finally,
meetings must be held in ways that allow remote people to not only participate
but actively contribute to the conversation. Most often that means getting the
basics right so that decent audio and video quality is ensured. A meeting with 4
people in the same (large enough, and well aired) room with one of them joining
a video call from their notebook to allow a remote person to join is never going
to end up in a proper experience for them since they will usually barely be able
to follow the conversation, much less contribute to it. Appropriate conference
microphones and cameras go a long way and are negligible investments in
comparison to the loss of collaboration that is unpreventable if they are
lacking.

Besides hardware, software tooling obviously plays a key factor for a thriving
remote setup. There are mainly three different kinds of tooling remote digital
product development organizations need:

- Immediate Communication: tools like team chat and message boards enable ad-hoc
  communication and act as a replacement for the classic water cooler chat.
  While these tools are relevant and necessary though, it's critical to be aware
  they are essentially ephemeral in nature – of course most of these tools do
  actually archive all communication so in theory it would be accessible later
  on, good luck finding a discussion on a particular topic that's scattered
  around different threads that happened on Slack a few days ago or a particular
  piece of information in an email thread from yesterday.
- Knowledge Management: these tools allow collaboratively creating, sharing and
  keeping relevant information. They are the remote equivalent of whiteboards
  and the place where feature descriptions or strategy documents would live.
  They must allow everyone to contribute to the information, have version
  tracking so people can understand who made what change and have a commenting
  functionality so teams can have conversations about the content.
- Work item tracking: tools that track individual work items are the main means
  of organizing work among remote teams and clearly communicate the status of
  each item to everyone. They are not mainly for tracking individual team
  members' progress and performance but help others to synchronize their
  potentially dependent work and identify blockers.

For all of the above categories, there are plenty of options available. While
all have their own pros and cons, picking a set of tools for any particular team
is mostly a matter of personal preference and there is no right or wrong choice.
What matters instead are a number of higher level points when introducing and
using any tools:

- Accessibility: tools being accessible to everyone who needs them might sound
  trivial but in reality is often a bigger issue than one might think. People
  are struggling with remembering URLs for tools, VPNs that many companies
  require are often unstable or hard to set up and keep working. Anyone who is
  not able to access a particular tool though is blocked from contributing their
  work.
- Availability: any set of tools a team might choose must also be available. The
  tools a team uses constitute the team's backbone and if they are not available
  for some reason, the team will be blocked from working. That means tools must
  be stable and not be offline but also fast and usable. While many companies
  desire to self-host everything in an effort to be on top of their
  infrastructure, in my experience that's often the worse choice and leads to
  friction and people being blocked – unless you're a company that specializes
  in hosting these tools, you'll likely do a much worse job doing so than any
  third party provider you'd be to host things for you!
- Acceptance: in particular teams and companies that adopt remote work and the
  respective tools relatively new often struggle with a lack of acceptance of
  these tools among the team. People would still send each other emails or
  direct messages on Slack instead of publicly commenting relevant information
  on the respective tools so that the information would be available for the
  rest of the team as well. It is critical for everyone in remote teams to
  understand that this is not merely about their personal convenience but opting
  out of using the tools a team has agreed on means opting out of collaborating
  altogether and is harmful to the entire team!

Problems adapting their minds to remote work is not only something that team
members struggle with sometimes. It's also relatively widespread among
management. A common fear when adopting remote work is _"How can I know my team
actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"_ However, in my experience
that kind of thinking generally only reveals a lack of management competence and
trust. People are not likely to work less or worse only because they do not work
from a company-assigned location. If working from the office actually means they
would be observed and controlled closely by their management team, working
remotely would likely even result in an improvement of productivity since the
oversight is not something people would have to worry about anymore
(nevertheless their management should reconsider their practices). In fact,
increased productivity and better focus was among the top reasons that people
choose to work remotely according to a recent study
(https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/website/sorw/2020/owl-labs_sorw-2020_report-download_FINAL_07oct2020.pdf?).

What I see many managers, confronted with a suddenly remote team doing, is being
on everyone's back even more than they might be in the office. The occasional

> Hey 👋 How's it going? Project Manager is typing… Just wanted to check where
> we are with feature x? Everything still on schedule?

is just as annoying on Slack as it is in real life and, which is much worse,
hugely interrupting. As said above, remote teams need to leverage cloud based
tools like issue trackers etc. and those are the tools where status and progress
is communicated.

With the freedom of remote work comes an increased demand for each team member's
ability to self-organize. While remote communication tools are great, taking
people by the hand remotely is harder than it might be in an office. People will
have to have a more proactive attitude, actively reach out for help or
information they need. The second important skill for anyone working remotely is
communication skills. While that seems counter-intuitive as it might seem remote
teams communicate **less** than teams with everyone in the same office, they
communicate differently and often even more. Instead of the random water cooler
chat, remote teams communicate a lot in written form using the tools discussed
above. Written communication is very different from direct verbal communication
though and it's harder to transport subtle meaning and detail and at the same
time it is easy to be misunderstood or (accidentally) offensive. A key ability
for anyone who wants to work remotely successfully, is the ability to express
themselves in writing.

Finally, when it comes to remote work, one concern is how teams can keep up
their team spirit and feeling of connection. After all, when everyone works from
a different location, you cannot go for lunch together, have an after-work beer
or the occasional round of Mario Kart in between work. Many people have
experienced that in their personal lives in the recent months and will continue
to do so in winter most likely. Virtual drinks are nice and all but the reality
is they cannot be a replacement for real-life, face-to-face interaction. A few
occasions every year where everyone comes together physically for a day or two
totally make up for the lack of physical connection for the rest of the year
though (when coming together, remember to take the train over flying though).

Besides that, there are plenty of other things you can and should do. Having a
weekly call with the entire team (or sub-team depending on the number of people)
where everyone gets to see each other (cameras on!) and talk for 30min or an
hour is invaluable for making sure people don't forget the faces and people
behind the screen names they interact with during work. Until we all are able to
have these kinds of events again though, there are plenty of alternatives like
remote board game sessions and even remote retreats!

Remote work has been a hot topic in the tech community for decades. While in the
late 90s and early 2000s, relatively few people were actually doing it and there
were quite some limitations to overcome to make it work at all, today in 2020,
remote work is well possible in many industries and even the norm for many
companies already. And of course the global pandemic that forced everyone to
work from home gave remote work an extra push. In this guide, we will share some
techniques to make a remote working model actually work well for everyone and
not just something we all have to cope with because an international crisis
struck.

<!--break-->

There are many more positive reasons to adopt a remote working model than a
potentially deadly virus. Employees get to choose where to live independently of
where they work and save a lot of time and money on sometimes long commutes
(which is also great for the climate – with all the focus currently being on
Covid 19 we must all not forget about the real existential crisis humanity is
facing after all). Companies also benefit as they can attract talent from
anywhere and are not limited in terms of who they can hire by their location.

Yet, even as employees and companies alike are eager to adopt remote work and in
theory all the tools and infrastructure that is needed for it is available, it
is still not easy to get right. Many teams and companies are struggling
switching to a fully or partly remote working model and yearn for the return of
the days of the office. The reality is those days are not going to come back in
many industries though and making remote work a success is going to be one of
the key challenges many companies will be facing in the coming years.

We have run simplabs as a remote company since the beginning. In the early days,
we've faced many of the same challenges other teams are struggling with now.
Over time, we overcame each one though and learned a lot along the way. Today,
we have team members in six countries across Europe with people working from
co-working offices in Berlin, kitchens in Augsburg, sheds in Dublin or even from
a sailboat in Portugal. And we're not the only ones enjoying the many advantages
of working remotely – 90% of remote workers say they plan to remain remote for
the rest of their careers and 94% would even encourage others to work remotely
as well according to
[a study](https://buffer.com/resources/state-remote-work-2018/) that was
conducted in 2018, so even before the pandemic.

## A remote culture

One of the key insights we gained is understanding that remote work is
fundamentally different from working in an office. Going remote cannot mean
mimicking the office and continuing to do the same things, just now remotely. It
requires sometimes substantially different practices when it comes to
collaboration and management and a lot of attention to aspects that are less
relevant when every team member works from the same location.

Possibly the single most important of these aspects is transparency and the flow
and sharing of information. People being out of the loop and not having access
to information that is relevant for their work, is probably the worst threat
remote teams face. While diagrams, concepts or calendars pinned to the wall (or
the sticky-notes sprint board that has turned into a status symbol for teams
that "do agile" in the past years) are reasonable and probably good tools for
sharing information among people that all work from the same location, for
remote team members all of that information is completely invisible. At the same
time, the information is probably relevant for them and not having access to it
means they cannot do their job properly.

TODO: image – burn down your sticky notes walls

The need for transparency and equal access to information for all team members
is also the reason why even companies that only have a few or even only a single
team member work remotely must adopt a remote culture to make that a success.
When most of the team is still working from the same office, it is easy to
forget about the remote team members, still continue with the same practices as
before and only keep the remote people in the loop by sending them occasional
updates or bringing them in remotely to otherwise in-office meetings. However,
doing that necessarily alienates the remote team members – they lack
transparency and cannot participate in decision making processes – or even if
they are given the opportunity to give their input and express opinions, they
won't be able to do so simply because they lack the necessary insights.

Adopting a remote working model really is an all–or–nothing kind of change.
While direct communication in the office is not something anyone should
prohibit, all the information and decisions that are made in any conversations
must be made transparent for the entire team. While writing summaries and
protocols or communicating via a chat tool although sitting at the desk next to
the person one is having a conversation with feels strange in the beginning, it
is a prerequisite for making remote work work at all. In that sense, the
pandemic that forced teams to go fully remote all at once at the same time might
even have made that easier rather than harder because everyone suddenly was in
the same position and shared the same perspective.

In the longer term, working remotely is not going to be for everyone though and
should not be something that is forced on people. Different people will be able
to adapt to remote work to different extents. Out of personal experience, I can
say forcing parents with little kids and no dedicate office room to work from
home means a huge challenge for their entire families (as I'm sure many people
have experienced first hand during the international lockdowns). The cultural
change needs to be complete but that does not mean all of a team have to work
remote all of the time.

### Trust

A very important cultural aspect of switching to a fully or partly remote
working model is trust. Many managers' first reaction when faced with their
teams working remotely is asking

_"How can I know my team actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"_

Just because managers cannot **see** the work happening does not mean it does
not happen though. Managers' desire for micro-managing teams is an equally bad
habit regardless of whether the team is remote or not – yet, remote teams seem
to increase that desire, often resulting in managers being on everyone's back
constantly and consistently even more than with all of the team working from the
office. However, the occasional Slack message

TODO: convert this to image

> Hey 👋 How's it going? Project Manager is typing… Just wanted to check where
> we are with feature x? Everything still on schedule?

is just as annoying on Slack as it is in real life. The reality is that remote
workers are likely more productive rather than less as they will find it easier
to focus and be less stressed according to a
[study from 2019](https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/Owl%20Labs%202019%20State%20of%20Remote%20Work%20Report%20PDF.pdf).
Building up that trust and giving people uninterrupted time to focus while
giving up on micro-management practices is going to be a task for many managers
to learn over the next years.

## Infrastructure and tooling

Working remotely requires adapting a number of infrastructure and tooling. There
is a plethora of great tools available and many companies are even using some of
them already. Which exact tools a team uses is not even so relevant and there
are plenty of options available – mostly those fall into three categories:

- tools for ad-hoc, realtime communication
- tools for knowledge management and sharing
- tools for organizing work and communicating status

While it is important to have tools for all of these use cases, it is equally
important to keep the total number of tools in use to a minimum to prevent
chaos. There is always going to be the new hip tool that everyone wants to try
and doing so often silently makes that new tool part of the de-facto toolset a
team uses, growing that little by little over time. Eventually teams then end up
with entire landscapes of tools, where nobody knows what kind of information
goes where and although each tool is perfectly good in isolation, in combination
they cause more confusion than they support the team.

### Tools for ad-hoc, realtime communication

Team chat tools like Slack (or Microsoft Teams for the more classic companies)
have seen widespread adoption over the past years and there are only few
companies that don't use any of those at this point. They have developed into
the backbone for remote work for many teams. While in an office environment,
sending someone or a group of people a chat message saves you having to walk
over to a separate room or building, in a remote environment it is the **only**
way to reach out to someone directly (unless you call the person but who does
phone calls anymore?). What's easy to forget though is how interruptive these
tools can be. Sending someone a chat message always implies urgency. Even if we
all know the majority of chat messages we get are in fact not urgent, it's hard
to ignore someone who just starts talking (writing) to you.

While most remote workers experience it being easier to focus, liberal
communication style on team chat can demolish a lot of that increased focus
again. For effective communication, it is important to be respectful of other
people's time and need to focus on their work. Not everything is urgent all of
the time and justifies notifying a coworker or even group of people. In many
cases, sending an email that is going to be less intrusive and more respectful
of the recipient's time can be the better option than sending the person a
message on team chat asking for something that could totally wait until tomorrow
as well.

At the same time, it is important to keep people in the loop and ensure
transparency of communication when using any kind of communication tool.
Communication that happens via direct messages between two people is invisible
to everyone else, although it might actually be relevant to others as well. As a
rule of thumb we recommend keeping everything in public channels until the topic
is strictly confidential or private in nature.

Although information in public channels will be accessible to everyone, it is
important to understand any realtime communication tool is essentially ephemeral
in nature. While that is not technically correct and most tools do in fact store
all communication indefinitely, it is practically close to impossible to find a
piece of information your are looking for that was discussed in some Slack
channel (you likely don't even remember which one) the day before. So while team
chat is a good mechanism to communicate among the team in a low effort, informal
way – any information or decisions that are made via it need to eventually make
their way into other, more permanent and organized systems.

#### Video Conferencing

Besides text based communication systems, of course video conferences play a
major role in remote work as well. That way of communication has seen a huge
boost in adoption during the pandemic with everyone isolating at home and many
people using video calls for the first time even (I'm sure everyone had their
_"Dad, the camera is pointing on the floor"_ moments). While late adopters
expectedly struggled with the technology, many remote teams experience similar
problems during their daily work lives. Poor audio or video quality, dogs
barking in the background, calls starting 10min late until everyone has figured
out their setup etc. are common problems for many teams and have a severe
negative effect on meeting efficiency.

All these problems are easy to get right though when following a number of
simple practices:

- There needs to be proper audio and video hardware in place. For groups joining
  a call together that means a proper conference speaker that ensures people on
  the other end will be able to hear everyone in the room even if more than one
  person speaks at the same time and ideally a wall-mounted webcam that shows
  the entire room. For people joining individually, it means they must use
  headsets that ensure good audio quality and do not also capture all of their
  surrounding.
- Turning cameras on so people can see each other makes a big difference in
  communication style – seeing someone's facial expression when they say
  something can often prevent misinterpreting what they are saying. And people
  can still be as sluggish as they like – dressing the upper body is totally
  enough for a video call.
- Muting yourself when you're not speaking is good practice but don't forget to
  unmute yourself when you want to say something – luckily most platforms have
  notifications now that warn people if they are speaking while being muted.
- Choosing an appropriate place for joining calls is a matter of respect for the
  other participants. While joining from a nice Café or the beach might seem
  like a good idea, it is likely distracting for everyone else who will be
  exposed to the background noises, people walking around in the background,
  waiters interrupting etc.

### Tools for knowledge management and sharing

Knowledge and information management is critical for every team and as discussed
previously access to all relevant information and transparency across the team
is essential for making a remote working model work at all. Tools for that allow
collaboratively creating, sharing and keeping relevant information. They are the
remote equivalent of whiteboards and the place where feature descriptions or
strategy documents would live. They must allow everyone to contribute to the
information, have versioning so people can understand who made what change when
and have commenting functionality so that people can have discussions about the
content.

### Tools for organizing work and communicating status

Tools that track individual work items are the main means of organizing work
among remote teams and clearly communicate the status of each item to everyone.
They are not for tracking individual team members' progress and performance but
help others to synchronize their potentially dependent work and identify
blockers. Properly describing the work each item represents, keeping its status
up to date, linking relevant information and decisions to the respective item
are essential practices to allow teams to understand what others are working on
and how that might influence what every team member does.

### The three A's

Whenever switching from a working model that is focussed on an office to a
remote one that will be entirely based on cloud–based tools, it is important to
keep what I'd call the three A's in mind:

- **Accessibility**: tools being accessible to everyone who needs them might
  sound trivial but in reality is often a bigger issue than one might think. In
  reality, people are struggling with remembering URLs or accounts for tools or
  VPNs might be unstable. And of course accessibility for people with special
  needs is critical as well to not exclude entire groups of people potentially.
  Anyone who is not able to access a particular tool is effectively blocked from
  working altogether.
- **Availability**: any set of tools a team might choose must also be available.
  The tools a team uses constitute its backbone and if they are not available
  for some reason, the entire team will be blocked from doing any work. While
  many companies desire to self-host everything in an effort to be on top of
  their infrastructure, in my experience that's often the worst choice and leads
  to friction and people being blocked – unless you're a company that
  specializes in hosting these kinds of tools, you'll likely do a much worse job
  doing so than any third party provider you'd be paying to host things for you!
- **Acceptance**: in particular teams and companies that adopt remote work and
  the respective tools relatively new often struggle with a lack of acceptance
  of these tools among the team. People would sometimes stick to their old
  habits, bypassing the tools and by that add lots of friction for everyone
  else. It is critical for every member of a partially or fully remote team
  though to understand that opting out of using the tools that are put in place
  means opting out of collaboration altogether.

## Distributed together

A challenge that many people adopting remote work face is loneliness. 20% of
remote workers say they feel lonely occasionally according to a
[study from this year](https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020). Also
working from their homes is not for everyone and some people need a clear
separation between their work and private environments or want to be among
others during the day. However, a remote working model does not necessarily
require everyone to work alone. Teams can still have an office but make that
optional or people could work from coworking locations where they are surrounded
by others although those people might not be their immediate teammates. After
all, remote work is all about options, not about forcing a particular working
environment on anyone. At simplabs, we give everyone the freedom to choose the
work location that is best for them and the only things we ask for are to ensure
a proper internet connection and for everyone to be in similar timezones – other
companies with a less collaborative working style might not even require that
and would sometimes allow people to work from anywhere on earth really.

Besides everyone feeling comfortable about their individual work environments,
it is also important to keep up a feeling of belonging together and, in fact,
being part of one team although everyone is physically distributed. As everyone
experienced firsthand throughout the pandemic, social interaction via video
calls is not the same as direct, face-to-face interaction though. In our
experience, it is essential for everyone to meet each other in the same location
at least twice per year. We organize company events where we all come together
for a day or two and do something nice together. These events are not about work
since all of that can be done remotely as well – we use them purely to enable
direct social interaction and keep up our notion of belonging together. Other
companies do similar things, sometimes flying in hundreds of people from all
across the globe. While that imposes substantial cost of course, that cost is
paid back manifold through a boosted team spirit that makes people enjoy work
more, relate to their teammates and their individual situations and finally
making collaboration smoother and more efficient.

Of course these kinds of events are not possible during the pandemic. And while
there is no substitue for these events we need not despair. There are plenty of
alternatives that help us all to get through these times with our personal
environment and similar things can be done in the professional environment as
well. Options start with regular calls with the entire team so that everyone
sees each other every now and then, even if it's just on camera. It doesn't need
to stop there though – you can do virtual drink-ups, game sessions, hackathons
and plenty other activities. These are invaluable for making sure teams don't
forget the faces and people behind the screen names they interact with during
work. And when we can, we'll all meet our friends but also our coworkers in real
life again and celebrate together.

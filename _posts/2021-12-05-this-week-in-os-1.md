Our software engineers are all active members of the open-source community and
enjoy collaborating on various projects. In this blog post, we have collected
some of the work they have done these past weeks!

<!--break-->

## Highlight

This week our senior software engineer [Tobias Bieniek] did a little bit of
design work on [crates.io], the [Rust] package registry. The website now has a
[new page footer](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/4158) and a
[cute little 404 page](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/4154):

## ember-simple-auth

ESA 4.0: Refactored internals of the addon to use Emberâ€™s dependency injection,
making things simpler and easier to test. Successfully removed a lot of code,
and simplified tests setup.

- [simplabs/ember-simple-auth] [#2315] [2302] put internal-session into DI
  system (https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/pull/2315)
  ([@BobrImperator])
- [simplabs/ember-simple-auth] [#2312] [2308] Refactor Adaptive store to use DI
  (https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/pull/2312) ([@BobrImperator])

ESA 4.1: implemented a session #setup method. The methos represents a first step
to migrating from custom initializers, it excludes the application route that
ESA adds automatically and that is causing build issues for embroider and
typescript users.

- [simplabs/ember-simple-auth] [#2314] Add #setup method to session service
  (https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/2314) ([@BobrImperator])

## JavaScript

Added a setup node and merged cache:

- [remy/nodemon] [#1934] ci(node.js): workflow uses 'npm' cache
  (https://github.com/remy/nodemon/pull/1934) ([@oscard0m])
- [remy/nodemon] [#1933] ci(release): workflow uses 'npm' cache
  (https://github.com/remy/nodemon/pull/1933) ([@oscard0m])

Merged PR:

- [strapi/strapi] [#11531] Add cache to node workflows
  (https://github.com/strapi/strapi/pull/11531) ([@oscard0m])

- [storybookjs/storybook] [#15969] Core: Add 'staticDirs' config option
  (https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/15969) ([@oscard0m])

- [storybookjs/eslint-plugin-storybook] [issue:] ESLint error: TypeError: Cannot
  read property 'properties' of undefined
  (https://github.com/storybookjs/eslint-plugin-storybook/issues/5)
  ([@oscard0m])
- [storybookjs/eslint-plugin-storybook] [issue:] ESLint error: TypeError: Cannot
  read property 'name' of undefined
  (https://github.com/storybookjs/eslint-plugin-storybook/issues/7)
  ([@oscard0m])

Making sure your web app is accessible can be a daunting task. Just as having a
good testing suite or an app that's responsive and works well across devices, it
seems easier to achieve when you're starting a new project than when working
with an existing app. Knowing where to start can be tough, therefore we've
outlined how to implement accessibility tests in Ember alongside a very common
case: forms.

![improve the accessibility of your app illustration](/assets/images/posts/2020-06-02-how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/illustration.png#full@720-1440)

For some time now, there's been an ongoing effort in the Ember community to make
accessibility an integral part of the framework. A handful of tools and
resources have been created to give developers an easier time building
accessible apps. One interesting tool, in particular, is
[ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing), which
helps detect accessibility violations during both testing and development.

While working on a client project, we decided to improve the accessibility of
that app, and using this tool in our tests seemed like it would be a good start.
The first question we came across was, **what's the best way to introduce these
tests when you have an app with an already big testing suite?**

At the time, the best answer for us was to create dedicated acceptance tests for
accessibility, that would go through a couple of important flows within the app
rather than add those checks on the already existing tests. The reason for this
was that we were dealing with an incomplete testing suite where tests didn't
follow the same patterns, some would test flows, others would test just parts of
a page, so it was hard to define where to add the accessibility checks so they
would bring the most value.

To add accessibility checks, simply install the add-on and use it in your tests,
here's an example of an acceptance test:

```js
import { visit } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit';
import { module, test } from 'qunit';

import a11yAudit from 'ember-a11y-testing/test-support/audit';

module('Acceptance | accessibility check', function (hooks) {
  setupApplicationTest(hooks);

  test('sign in page has no accessibility issues', async function (assert) {
    await visit('/signin');

    await a11yAudit();

    // you need at least one assert, so if all a11y checks pass
    // so does your test
    assert.ok(true, 'no a11y errors found!');
  });
});
```

You can also add these validations to integration tests. While you are creating
integration tests for components, you could easily add a few extra tests that
check for accessibility issues. If you already have well-tested components, it
could be interesting to adopt the accessibility checks as part of the
development process, making sure that both new components and improvements to
existing components don't introduce any violations of accessibility rules

```js
import { render } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit';
import hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile';
import { module, test } from 'qunit';

import a11yAudit from 'ember-a11y-testing/test-support/audit';

module('Component | login-form', function (hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);

  test('login form has no accessibility issues', async function (assert) {
    await render(hbs`<LoginForm/>`);

    await a11yAudit();
    assert.ok(true, 'no a11y errors found!');
  });
});
```

The `a11yAudit` helper will inspect the rendered page or component and it will
raise an error if it finds any accessibility violations. The great thing about
this is that it will list all violations with the respective severities and will
even include a link to documentation for that rule, which includes an
explanation of why the rule exists and how to fix it. For instance,
[here's the information](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.5/autocomplete-valid?application=axeAPI)
for one of the validation errors we're getting.

![example of errors thrown by a11y in an acceptance test](/assets/images/posts/2020-06-02-how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/acceptance-test-error.png#@1024-2048)

One issue we ran into, was that these tests brought up a lot of accessibility
violations, some of which we couldn't just fix on our own. For example, several
of the errors were due to color contrast issues, in a lot of cases, deciding on
(and changing) color schemes may not be entirely in your power, and it can
involve discussions with designers, product owners, and may even be influenced
by branding, but you can and should use this information to spark those
discussions and promote change.

If you're in the same situation and fixing those errors is not something that
can be done all at once, you can opt for muting validations and taking an
incremental approach to making these improvements (similar to the upgrade path
in Ember where you can mute deprecations and work on them step by step).

```js
test('sign in page has no accessibility issues', async function (assert) {
  let axeOptions = {
    rules: {
      'autocomplete-valid': {
        enabled: false,
      },
      'duplicate-id': {
        enabled: false,
      },
      label: {
        enabled: false,
      },
      'link-name': {
        enabled: false,
      },
    },
  };
  await visit('/signin');

  await a11yAudit(axeOptions);
  assert.ok(true, 'no a11y errors found!');
});
```

If you happen to have a very long list of rules to mutate, you may want to do
something like:

```js
function axeOptions(disabledRules) {
  let rules = {};

  disabledRules.forEach((r) => {
    rules[r] = { enabled: false };
  });

  return { rules };
}

test('sign in page has no accessibility issues', async function (assert) {
  await visit('/signin');

  await a11yAudit(
    axeOptions(['autocomplete-valid', 'duplicate-id', 'label', 'link-name']),
  );
  assert.ok(true, 'no a11y errors found!');
});
```

You can then re-enable the rules one by one as you fix the violations.

The [ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing)
add-on provides other helpers, options and can even be used in development to
detect these issues visually while you work,
[so don't forget to read the docs!](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing)

## A few accessibility considerations when implementing forms

Back to our existing app case, we realized that using the test information and
fixing identified issues as an effort in itself (independent from feature
development) would take a lot of time and was going to be a tough sell. So we
decided to start acting on these improvements gradually, and taking a more
mindful approach when developing, trying not to introduce new issues and make
improvements where possible. One of these opportunities presented itself when
making improvements to a relatively simple page with a form.

Here are some of the things we had to improve, and why you should keep them in
mind.

### Labels, labels, labels

This may seem obvious, but your inputs should have labels that indicate what
information is required. The maybe not so obvious part is that labels should be
linked to those inputs. As an example, the failing test above: the labels exist
and are visually on top of the inputs, but in the HTML it is not clear the label
belongs to that input.

```html
<div id="ember8" class="x-label ember-view">
  <label class="x-label__label">
    Email address
  </label>
</div>
<div id="ember9" class="x-input-beta ember-view">
  <input
    placeholder="Enter your email address"
    autocomplete="off"
    class="x-input-beta__input"
    type="email"
  />
</div>
```

There are different options to fix this: rearrange the HTML and have the label
wrap the input, use the `for` attribute on the label to point to the input's
`id`, using `aria-labeledby` on the input to point to the label's `id`, or if
none of this is an option that works in your case, use `aria-label` on your
input as shown below:

```html
<input
  placeholder="Enter your email address"
  type="email"
  aria-label="Email address"
/>
```

Ideally, this should match the visual label to avoid any possible confusion.

### Labels and placeholders that make sense

Missing labels are one of the possible violations that
[ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing) will
detect for you, but having labels that make sense, on their own and in the
context of the form and page, is something that only you can do, no automatic
tools will do it for you (as far as I know). To understand why and also to have
a better idea of how accessible your app is, I highly suggest using a screen
reader to navigate your page and try to perform the action you want your users
to perform (in this case, filling out a form and submitting it). I can assure
you if you've never done it before, it will be mind-opening.

Now, I know using a screen reader is not something everyone is acquainted with
(I wasn't), you can find resources on how to start
([like this one](http://uncaughtreferenceerror.com/a-crash-course-to-screenreaders-for-sighted-developers/))
and if you use a Mac for development, you can use Voice Over which already comes
installed. Just think of it as another tool that should be part of your
development process.

### Groups of fields

Another interesting case we came across was a group of inputs we had for
entering a date. There were three inputs, for the day, month and year and they
had the placeholders "DD", "MM", "YYYY". This may seem clear enough when looking
at the whole page, but can be strange when you're using your keyboard to
navigate and listen 'DD' as the whole explanation for the field. Even having
labels such as 'Day', 'Month', 'Year' may not be sufficient context. In this
case, we found that using `fieldset` was a good option. When you have a
`fieldset` with a legend, the screen reader will include this information when
giving you the information of an input it contains. This is what the screen
reader says when the legend is present:

![image of screen reader info for an input in a group with fieldset legend](/assets/images/posts/2020-06-02-how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/group-with-fieldset-legend.png#@1024-2048)

Versus when it's not:

![image of screen reader info for an input in a group without a fieldset legend](/assets/images/posts/2020-06-02-how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/group-without-fieldset-legend.png#@1024-2048)

Another case where you should consider using a `fieldset` is whenever you have
big forms that may have a logical grouping of fields, for instance, a group of
inputs relating to an address inside a bigger form.

![address form example](/assets/images/posts/2020-06-02-how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/address-form.png#@900-1800)

In such cases, it is better to use a `fieldset` with a `legend`,
`<legend>Postal address</legend>`, instead of a heading element and a `div`
grouping the fields.

### Tab index

If you have a well-structured page and you're not rearranging input orders by
CSS or JS, your best bet is to just rely on the browser and not set a tab index
value on your inputs. This will ensure that when navigating with the keyboard
you will move through the form as you would expect, in the order the elements
are shown on the screen.

This is not always possible, and in some cases, you will have to resort to
setting `tabindex` to make sure the keyboard navigation is consistent. Always
make sure to test these cases manually, there's nothing more frustrating than
having the inputs being skipped or having a jumping order when using only the
keyboard to fill out forms.

### Visually indicating focus

For those sighted users that rely on keyboard navigation, being able to
determine visually when an input is focused is also important. When using native
inputs with their default styles, the browser will take care of this for you.
But we often rely on custom implementations of inputs to make them more visually
appealing and forget to set specific styles for the focused state. This can
create a scenario where you tab through the fields of your form and have no idea
where exactly you're focused until you try to enter some content.

One scenario where this might happen is when the `outline` of elements is set to
none. This is usually to avoid the browser's default outline.

![select-with-default-outline](/assets/images/posts/2020-06-02-how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/select-with-default-outline.png#@700-1400)

In this scenario, don't forget to set a style for the `:focus` state. For
instance, the following can be achieved by the CSS below.

![select-with-custom-outline](/assets/images/posts/2020-06-02-how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/select-with-custom-outline.png#@700-1400)

```css
select:focus {
  border-color: #01c3a7;
}
```

Another scenario is when creating custom checkboxes, which usually involve not
showing an actual checkbox. This may be a more complicated case, but if your
custom implementation includes a hidden checkbox, you can use that to set the
focused style. If not, you should reconsider your implementation.

For example, the following checkbox can be implemented with the code below,
where the actual checkbox is hidden but is still used for the states.

| unfocused                                                                                                                                | checked                                                                                                                                | focused                                                                                                                              |

  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  border: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

input[type='checkbox'].custom-checkbox + span {
  position: relative;
}

input[type='checkbox'].custom-checkbox + *::before {
  content: ' ';
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  width: 18px;
  height: 18px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 1px #c0c9cc solid;
  background: #fff;
}

input[type='checkbox'].custom-checkbox:checked + *::before {
  background: #01c3a7 url(images/checkmark_success_white.svg) center no-repeat;
  border-color: #01c3a7;
  background-size: 60%;
}

/* our focus style */
input[type='checkbox'].custom-checkbox:focus + *::before {
  border-color: #01c3a7;
}
```

### Enter should submit your form

Another thing you should always check is being able to submit the form using
just the keyboard. Especially when developing an Ember app, you may implement
forms that don't include an actual `form` element. Whether that's the case or
not, at least the submit button should respond to `Enter`, and why not... even
the other fields.

This is by no means a comprehensive list, there are other accessibility
considerations to have in mind when working with forms, such as making sure
errors are detected by the screen reader, that custom components behave well
when using just the keyboard, etc. The important thing to remember is you're not
alone in this, there are [tools](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y) and
[resources](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/accessibility/components/) to
help, and if you don't know where to start, start with the tests.

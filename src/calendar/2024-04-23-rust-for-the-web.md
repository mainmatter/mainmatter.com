We are running an event together with the Rust Berlin meetup group focused on
using Rust for web development. The event will be held at

Engineering Consultant, Luca Palmieri, will lead through the evening. We'll have
talks from Ryan Levick, Rust leadership council alumni and Principal Software
Engineer at Fermyon as well as Jonas Dohse, Tech Lead at SAP Signavio. The

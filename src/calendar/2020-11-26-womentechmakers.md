Women Techmakers Berlin has been encouraging diversity in tech in Berlin
since 2015. They strive for visibility, networking and resources to make the
tech community of Berlin inclusive. They are one of the most active chapters of
the global Women Techmakers program run by Google.

On November 26th, Mar High will be giving a talk about version control in
design. Version control systems (VCS) have long been used by software engineers
to manage their codebases and collaborate effectively. In this talk, Mar will
explore best practices of VCS as they apply to user interface design, go over a
brief history, and analyze strengths and limitations of the most popular UI
design programs (Sketch & Adobe XD with Abstract, and Figma with Version
History).

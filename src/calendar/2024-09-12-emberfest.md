EmberFest is the European Community Ember Conference, this year happening in Dublin, on September 12th & 13th. If youâ€™re looking for updates on the latest and greatest in Ember and Glimmer this is the place to be. EmberFest is also a great opportunity to get in touch with the European Ember Community (and friends from abroad) and hiring Ember talent. Mainmatter is co-organizing the event and our team will be in Dublin in full force!

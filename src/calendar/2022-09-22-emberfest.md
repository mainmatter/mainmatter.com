EmberFest is the European Community Ember Conference happening in Paris, from the 22nd to the 23rd of September. If you’re looking for updates on the latest and greatest in Ember and Glimmer this is the place to be. EmberFest is also a great opportunity to get in touch with the European Ember Community (and friends from abroad) and hiring Ember talent. Like every year, we’re happy to be co-organizing the event!

OnProduct is a meetup for product people in Berlin. Their goal is to create a
living community of designers, product managers, developers, QA engineers that
exchange ideas, best practices and know how.

In case you miss the previous presentation, Mar High will share once again give
a talk about version control in design on December 10th. Version control systems
(VCS) have long been used by software engineers to manage their codebases and
collaborate effectively. In this talk, Mar will explore best practices of VCS as
they apply to user interface design, go over a brief history, and analyze
strengths and limitations of the most popular UI design programs (Sketch & Adobe
XD with Abstract, and Figma with Version History).

We are running a meetup together with Shuttle and Vortexa to share learnings and
success stories from using Rust in business. The event will be hosted by
TrueLayer in London. Our Principal Engineering Consultant, Luca Palmieri, will
discuss the missing steps in the Rust playbook and explain how to turn your bet
on Rust into a success in his talk.

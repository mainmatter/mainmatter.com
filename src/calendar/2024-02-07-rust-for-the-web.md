We are running an event together with Shuttle, Vortexa, and the Rust London meetup group focused on using Rust for web development. The event will be hosted by
TrueLayer in London on Feb. 7th, 2024. Our Principal Engineering Consultant, Luca Palmieri, will
present the playbook for successful Rust adoption as well as moderate a panel talking about success stories and challenges with David Cole from Arwen.ai and Nodar Daneliya  from Shuttle.

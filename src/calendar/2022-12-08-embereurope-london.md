Ember Europe is back in Q4 with the last event for the year, this time hosted by CrowdStrike in London. The Ember Europe meetup series brings together the Ember community from all of Europe once a quarter. The meetup is organized by Mainmatter and Intercom as a hybrid event, hosted from a different city each time with the option for people to join remotely as well.

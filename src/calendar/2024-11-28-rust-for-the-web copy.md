We're hosting an event in collaboration with the Rust Hamburg meetup group and
Otto. The event will take place at Collabor8, Otto in Hamburg, on November 28th.
Our Managing Director, Marco Otto-Witte, will give a talk titled "A Blueprint
for Rust/Axum Apps". In his talk, Marco will introduce Gerust's architecture,
its core principles, and provide an outlook on future plans for the project.

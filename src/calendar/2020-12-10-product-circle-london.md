Product Circle is an opportunity for all PMO's, Product Owners, Project
Managers, Delivery Leads, and anyone involved in a Digital Product / Project
team to come and network as well as to discuss trends and topics.

simplabs' founder and CEO Marco Otte-Witte will present at Product Circle's
Christmas Special and deliver a talk about the three pillars of effective
digital product development. In the talk, Marco will explain how successful
projects are scoped, planned and executed as well as what techniques and
strategies to avoid. He will also dive deep into how successful product teams
are structured and what is needed to establish an efficient infrastructure that
will support ambitious projects sustainably.

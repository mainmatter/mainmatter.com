EmberFest is the European Community Ember Conference, this year happening in
Madrid, from September 22nd to 23rd. If youâ€™re looking for updates on the latest
and greatest in Ember and Glimmer this is the place to be. EmberFest is also a
great opportunity to get in touch with the European Ember Community (and friends
from abroad) and hiring Ember talent. Mainmatter is co-organizing the event and
our team will be in Madrid in full force!

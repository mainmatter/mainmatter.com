We're hosting an event in collaboration with the Rust Hamburg meetup group and Otto in November. The event will take place at Otto's Collabor8 space in Hamburg, on November 28th. Mainmatter's Founder, Marco Otte-Witte, will introduce [gerust](https://github.com/mainmatter/gerust), a project generator and manager for Rust backend projects.

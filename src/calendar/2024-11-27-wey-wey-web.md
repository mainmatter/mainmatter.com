Wey Wey Web is an annual conference for UI enthusiasts, taking place in Málaga, Spain, this year. Mainmatter’s full-stack web developer, Paolo Ricciuti, will lead a workshop titled “Svelte and SvelteKit - From 0 to Fullstack,” where attendees will learn Svelte from the basics, progressing from a syntax showcase to building a fully scalable, full-stack, progressively enhanced application.

    <p>
      The use of the mainmatter.com is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if
      a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of
      personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and
      there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data
      subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone
      number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to
      the Mainmatter GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like
      to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we
      collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data
      protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the controller, the Mainmatter GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational
      measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this
      website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so
      absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to
      transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <p>
      The data protection declaration of the Mainmatter GmbH is based on the terms used by the
      European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our
      data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as
      well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain
      the terminology used.
    </p>

    <p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>

    <ul class="none">
      <li>
        <h2>a) Personal data</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
          person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
          directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
          identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
          specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
          identity of that natural person.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>b) Data subject</h2>
        <p>
          Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is
          processed by the controller responsible for the processing.

          sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
          organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation,
          use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or
          combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>e) Profiling</h2>
        <p>
          Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
          personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in
          particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at
          work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour,
          location or movements.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>f) Pseudonymisation</h2>
        <p>
          Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal
          data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
          information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject
          to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not
          attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h2>
        <p>
          Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person,
          public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
          purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of
          such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the
          specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>h) Processor</h2>
        <p>
          Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>i) Recipient</h2>
        <p>
          Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which
          the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities
          which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance
          with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of
          those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data
          protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>j) Third party</h2>
        <p>
          Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the
          data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the
          controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>k) Consent</h2>
        <p>
          Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous
          indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear
          affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him
          or her.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Name and Address of the controller</h2>
    <p>
      Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data
      protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related
      to data protection is:
    </p>

    <p>Mainmatter GmbH</p>
    <p>Hans-Sachs-Str. 12</p>
    <p>80469 München</p>
    <p>Deutschland</p>
    <p>Phone: +498945213903</p>
    <p>Email: info@mainmatter.com</p>
    <p>Website: mainmatter.com</p>

    <h2>3. Collection of general data and information</h2>
    <p>
      The website of the Mainmatter GmbH collects a series of general data and information when a
      data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are
      stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2)
      the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing
      system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time
      of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the
      Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
      information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      When using these general data and information, the Mainmatter GmbH does not draw any
      conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the
      content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its
      advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and
      website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary
      for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Mainmatter GmbH analyzes
      anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data
      protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection
      for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored
      separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Subscription to our newsletters</h2>
    <p>
      On the website of the Mainmatter GmbH, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our
      enterprise's newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data
      are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Mainmatter GmbH informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a
      newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise's newsletter may only be received by the
      data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject
      registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail
      address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal
      reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the
      owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer
      system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the
      time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of
      this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a
      data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the
      controller.
    </p>

    <p>
      The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to
      send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as
      long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in
      question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or
      in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal
      data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter
      may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal
      data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any
      time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each
      newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the
      website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Newsletter-Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      The newsletter of the Mainmatter GmbH contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is
      a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file
      recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online
      marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the Mainmatter GmbH may see if and
      when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by
      data subjects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored
      and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as
      to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.
      These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time
      entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the
      double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the
      controller. The Mainmatter GmbH automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the
      newsletter as a revocation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Contact possibility via the website</h2>
    <p>
      The website of the Mainmatter GmbH contains information that enables a quick electronic
      contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a
      general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts
      the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data
      subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a
      data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the
      data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Subscription to comments in the blog on the website</h2>
    <p>
      The comments made in the blog of the Mainmatter GmbH may be subscribed to by third parties. In
      particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his
      comments on a particular blog post.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic
      confirmation e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the
      specified e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to subscribe to comments
      may be terminated at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the
      period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the
      European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is
      subject to.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European
      legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or
      erased in accordance with legal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Rights of the data subject</h2>

          </li>
          <li>the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;</li>

            logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such
            processing for the data subject.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether

          Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the
          appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any
          time, contact any employee of the controller.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>c) Right to rectification</h2>
        <p>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from
          the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data
          concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data
          subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by
          means of providing a supplementary statement.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any
          time, contact any employee of the controller.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)</h2>
        <p>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from
          the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and
          the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where
          one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they
            were collected or otherwise processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point
            (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where
            there is no other legal ground for the processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and
            there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject
            objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.
          </li>
          <li>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</li>
          <li>
            The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or
            Member State law to which the controller is subject.
          </li>
          <li>
            The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society
            services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the
          erasure of personal data stored by the Mainmatter GmbH, he or she may, at any time,
          contact any employee of the controller. An employee of Mainmatter GmbH shall promptly
          ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article
          17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology
          and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures,
          to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has
          requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those
          personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of the Mainmatter GmbH
          will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.

      <li>
        <h2>e) Right of restriction of processing</h2>
        <p>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from
          the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period
            enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data
            and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but
            they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of
            legal claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR
            pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those
            of the data subject.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the
          restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the Mainmatter GmbH, he or she
          may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of the Mainmatter
          GmbH will arrange the restriction of the processing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>f) Right to data portability</h2>
        <p>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the
          personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured,
          commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit
          those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the
          personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant

        <h2>g) Right to object</h2>
        <p>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on
          grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of
          personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of
          the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Mainmatter GmbH shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the
          objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
          which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the
          establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the Mainmatter GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data
          subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data
          concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it
          is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the Mainmatter GmbH to
          the processing for direct marketing purposes, the Mainmatter GmbH will no longer process
          the personal data for these purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular
          situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the
          Mainmatter GmbH for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical
          purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the
          performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the
          Mainmatter GmbH. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of
          information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her
          right to object by automated means using technical specifications.

        <h2>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h2>
        <p>
          Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be
          subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which
          produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or
          her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance
          of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by
          Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down
          suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate
          interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract
          between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's
          explicit consent, the Mainmatter GmbH shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the
          data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain
          human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and
          contest the decision.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual
          decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Mainmatter GmbH.

          or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may,
          at any time, contact any employee of the Mainmatter GmbH.

    </p>

    <h2>17. Legal basis for the processing</h2>
    <p>
      Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain
      consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for
      the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example,
      when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other
      service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such
      processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for
      example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject
      to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the
      fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare
      cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the
      data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor
      were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital
      information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the
      processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be
      based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which
      are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the
      purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where
      such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
      subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly
      permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He
      considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the
      controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
    </p>

    <h2>18. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h2>
    <p>
      Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate
      interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the
      shareholders.
    </p>

    <h2>19. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h2>
    <p>
      The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective
      statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is
      routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or
      the initiation of a contract.
    </p>

    <h2>
      20. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary
      to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data;
      possible consequences of failure to provide such data
    </h2>
    <p>
      We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax
      regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the
      contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data
      subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data
      subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a
      contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence
      that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is
      provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
      clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or
      contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to
      provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.

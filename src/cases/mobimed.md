description: <p>mobi.MED builds software for medical practices in the DACH region.</p><p>Their internal team had built the software platform from the ground up over many years. When the team saw they were falling further behind recent Ember versions and technical debt was piling up, while at the same time they couldn't prioritize working on it due to pressure building features, they reached out to Mainmatter for support. We modernized their codebase and taught their team modern Ember patterns without interrupting their feature delivery.</p>

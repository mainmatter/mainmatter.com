### Solidifying sustainable strategies

Working closely with Trainline's engineering and product teams, we were able to deliver the first version of the mobile web app on time and on budget. We helped develop the team’s expertise through pair-programming sessions and code reviews.

In addition to our engineering work, we also helped Trainline establish an iterative approach to their engineering process. This enabled both their engineers and management to better prioritize tasks and measure project progress.

### More sales from happier customers

Beyond the core application, we spearheaded impovements in mobile performance, load times, server side rendering, and localization. Taken together, these changes resulted in a vastly improved user experience and, in turn, increased sales.

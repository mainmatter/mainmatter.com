        <p>Mainmatter has a unique combination of expertise both in building web applications as well as in Rust. We have built big web apps and mentored teams on design, backend and frontend with international clients such as Qonto, trainline, Experteer, and others. At the same time, we know the ins and outs of Rust. Several of our engineers have been on the crates.io team for years and we run workshops to teach others Rust.</p>

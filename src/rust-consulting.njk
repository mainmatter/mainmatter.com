          We’re experts - our Rust team is led by Luca Palmieri, author of
          <a href="http://zero2prod.com">"Zero to Production in Rust"</a>, and we have been part of
          the Rust ecosystem for years, helping out the

        <p>
          But we don't stop at Rust – we have developed big web apps and mentored teams on backend,
          frontend, design, as well as process and developer infrastructure for years. We know what
          it takes to connect everything together and deliver a delightful end-to-end experience.

          time this year. Plus, there'll be workshops on the day before the main conference, room
          for people to get together and hack on their favorite projects during the conference, as
          well as an after party on Friday night.

          Rust expert, is here to help your team. You walk him through your company's usecase and
          your requirements and he’ll do his best to suggest the best course of action. Sometimes

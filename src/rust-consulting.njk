      <p>
        We’re experts - our Rust team is led by Luca Palmieri, author of
        <a href="http://zero2prod.com">"Zero to Production in Rust"</a>, and we have been part of
        the Rust ecosystem for years, helping out the
        <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> project.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we don't stop at Rust – we have developed big systems and mentored teams on technology,
        as well as process and developer infrastructure for years. We know what it takes to connect
        everything together and develop performant, solid, and maintainable systems.

        there were workshops on the day before the main conference, several side activities around
        the event, as well as an after party on Friday night.

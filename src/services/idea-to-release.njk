description: "There are lots of reasons that a team gets overextended – lack of people, lack of expertise, or even lack of time. At Mainmatter, we’ve built a team of diverse expertise in web and cloud projects that deliver with a fresh perspective. We support our clients with experienced people who are ready to build products, mentor people and support your goals. "

        Any product is only as good as the assumptions it's built on. We’ll work with you to develop a product strategy based on validated product concepts. Strategic clarity based on market research, validation, and product principles enables us to iterate on ideas that work. The result is an MVP with a clear direction for follow-on improvements.

      <p class="body">
        Our product design process focuses on creating not a product but an experience – specifically experiences that users will love. Our approach starts with the stakeholders and their expectations and translating that into a wireframe. We ideate across the entire user journey to delight them with ease of use, smart design and visual appeal to create a better solution.

        Product development can pose a unique and complex engineering challenge – and that’s what we do best. We build for long-term sustainability with full-stack development delivered continuously in product increments that are intensively tested. The result is the quality that we know only comes from close collaboration between designers and developers.

      <h3 class="mb-2">Our methodology</h3>
      <p class="body">
        All our workshops are hands-on. We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Our
        trainers introduce concepts and patterns but attendees spend the majority of their time
        during the workshops writing code, and applying those concepts in practical examples. This
        structure allows our trainers to spend most of their time in 1:1 conversations with
        attendees, providing tailored feedback and guidance.

        All our workshops can be held in-person or remotely. If you decide to organise a workshop at
        your company, we are happy to tailor the curriculum to your needs. We can combine multiple
        workshops, pick and choose modules, as well as develop new content if desired.<br />

      <h3 class="mb-2">Our methodology</h3>
      <p class="body">
        All our workshops are hands-on. We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Workshop attendees
        spend most of their time writing code, working through exercises with automated solution-checking.
        This structure allows our trainers to spend most of their time in 1:1 conversations with attendees,
        providing tailored feedback and guidance.

        All our workshops can be held in-person or remotely.
        If you decide to organise a workshop at your company, we are happy to tailor
          the curriculum to your needs. We can combine multiple workshops, pick and choose modules, as well as
          develop new content if desired.<br>

      <p>We’re experts - our Rust team is led by Luca Palmieri, author of <a href="http://zero2prod.com">"Zero to Production in Rust"</a>, and we have been part of the Rust ecosystem for years, helping out the <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> project.</p>
      <p>But we don't stop at Rust – we have developed big web apps and mentored teams on backend, frontend, design, as well as process and developer infrastructure for years. We know what it takes to connect everything together and deliver a delightful end-to-end experience.</p>

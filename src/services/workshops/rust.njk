        <p>We specialize on Rust on the backend: API services, workers, data pipelines.</p>
        <p>That focus shapes our training offering.<br>
           We can walk alongside you on a journey from zero to hero,
           starting from the basics of the language all the way to advanced testing techniques and comprehensive
           telemetry instrumentation.</p>

      <div class="split-content__text">
        <p>All our workshops are hands-on. We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Workshop attendees
           spend most of their time writing code, working through exercises with automated solution-checking.</p>
        <p>This structure allows our trainers to spend most of their time in 1:1 conversations with attendees,
           providing tailored feedback and guidance.</p>

      <div class="split-content__text">
        <p>All our workshops can be held in-person or remotely.</p>
        <p>If you decide to organise a workshop at your company, we are happy to tailor
          the curriculum to your needs. We can combine multiple workshops, pick and choose modules, as well as
          develop new content if desired.<br>
          <a href="https://calendly.com/luca-palmieri/is-rust-the-right-choice-for-us">Get in touch with us</a>
          to discuss further!</p>
        <p>From time to time, we also organize public workshops. <br>
           Public workshops are the ideal solution for independent developers and small teams: it's enough to buy a ticket to join!<br>
           The next one will be at <a href="https://www.rustnationuk.com/">RustNation UK</a> in London, on March 26th 2024—we'll
           be in charge of the Expert workshop.</p>

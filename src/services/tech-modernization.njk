      <p class="body">
        Upgrading your codebase also means making sure your team is equipped to take advantage of
        the updates. Reworking the codebase goes hand-in-hand with mentoring the team to make sure
        everyone is familiar with the new patterns each new version brings.

      <h3 class="mb-2">Save costs (in the long run)</h3>
      <p class="body">
        Technology is always iterating on itself – and that’s a cost on older technology. Conducting
        a complete rewrite will always be more expensive than a precise update. Our experience will
        ensure that the process will run smoothly without any surprises down the road.

    <div class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="mb-2">Keep delivering on your roadmap</h3>
      <p class="body">
        Leave the codebase to our experts so your team can keep delivering. We’ll work concurrently
        with your team to make sure that feature development doesn’t get stopped either by the
        update or outdated code.

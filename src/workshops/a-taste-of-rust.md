  <p>Rust has been the most loved programming language on StackOverflow for 7 years in a row. What's it all about?</p>
  <p>Join this workshop to get a taste of Rust! We'll cover the core concepts of the language: structs, enums, traits, 
  testing, key data structures.</p>
  <p>The workshop is designed for developers who have experience using other programming languages and are just getting started with Rust.</p>

      The workshop is organised as a series of exercises. You'll be learning by
      doing! Each concept will be introduced with a short presentation, followed
      by a hands-on exercise with tests to make sure you've wrapped your head
      around it.  
      By the end of the workshop, you'll have built a small command-line
      application in Rust: a simple JIRA clone that can be used to manage a
      backlog of tasks.

title: Hands-on Ember.js
format: 2-3 days remote
description:
  <p>We go through a series of stages that each build on one another. Each topic is introduced via an in-depth presentation as well as a small, focussed demo application that illustrates the respective concept in practice. Over the course of the workshop we take participants through building a full Ember application step by step so each topic can be applied hands-on with the support of our tutors. Depending on each team's needs and previous experience, we will cover each topic in varying depth. We are also happy to customize workshops for the specific needs of a team and cover topics like performance, debugging, upgrading from older versions of Ember, or any topics particular to a team's application.</p></br>

  <p>All examples and practical assignments from the workshop are available publicly on GitHub.</p>

topics:
  - heading: Ember.js basics
    text: >
      We look at the basic building blocks of an Ember application and how they play together. We also take a look at the CLI and development tooling like the Ember Inspector.
  - heading: Templates and components
    text: >
      Rendering DOM elements is the most essential task of every Ember app. We dive deep into Handlebars, Ember's component model, tracked properties as well as actions and modifiers and more advanced topics like complex component architectures, component reusability concerns, and architectural approaches.
  - heading: Routing
    text: >
      Ember pioneered the idea of driving the application state through the URL. In this stage, we explore Ember's routing, the template hierarchy, and advanced concepts like loading and error states.
  - heading: Ember Data
    text: >
      This stage covers all aspects of Ember Data, from the basics like working with models and the store, to advanced topics like adapters and serializers, the json:api spec, and data loading patterns.
  - heading: Services
    text: >
      Ember's services are a simple yet powerful mechanism for sharing state throughout the application as well as encapsulating specific functionality. We cover how services work and look at typical use cases and patterns.
  - heading: Testing
    text: >
      We cover fundamental authentication and authorization concepts, discussing different mechanisms and related security aspects.
optional_topics:
  - heading: Auth (optional)
    text: >
      We cover fundamental authentication and authorization concepts, discussing different mechanisms and related security aspects.
  - heading: Deployment, performance, SSR and SSG (optional)
    text: >
      In this stage, we look into serving Ember applications in the most performant way. We cover topics like CDNs, caching and service workers, as well as server-side rendering and pre-rendering with FastBoot.
  - heading: Ember’s object model (optional)
    text: >
      Ember applications building on versions older than the Octane edition are still using Ember's legacy object model with patterns like computed properties and mixins. In this stage, we cover those concepts in-depth as well as explore approaches for migrating to native classes.

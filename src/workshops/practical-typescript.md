topics:
  - title: TypeScript Fundamentals
    text: >
      We'll start with understanding what TypeScript is and why it's valuable, covering basic syntax, type annotations, and the development workflow with TypeScript tooling.


  - title: Basic Types and Type System
    text: >
      Deep dive into TypeScript's type system including primitives, objects, arrays, functions, and classes. We'll cover type inference and when explicit annotations are needed.


  - title: Unions and Type Narrowing
    text: >
      Learn to combine types with unions, work with literal types and template literals, and master type narrowing techniques including type guards and discriminated unions.


  - title: Intersections and Interfaces
    text: >
      Understand type intersections, the differences between types and interfaces, interface merging, and best practices for structuring complex type definitions.


  - title: Utility Types and Dynamic Keys
    text: >
      Explore TypeScript's built-in utility types like <code>Pick</code>, <code>Omit</code>, <code>Partial</code>, and <code>Record</code>. Learn to work with dynamic object keys and index signatures.


  - title: Classes and Object-Oriented Features
    text: >
      Cover TypeScript's class syntax, constructor shortcuts, access modifiers, inheritance, and TypeScript-specific features like parameter properties and enums.


  - title: Advanced Type Manipulation
    text: >
      Master <code>keyof</code>, <code>typeof</code>, index access types, and techniques for deriving types from existing structures to build more maintainable codebases.


  - title: Generics and Generic Constraints
    text: >
      Learn to write reusable, type-safe code with generics, including generic functions, constraints, default type parameters, and advanced patterns like mapped types.


  - title: Conditional Types and Advanced Patterns
    text: >
      Explore conditional types, the <code>infer</code> keyword, branded types, and advanced TypeScript patterns used in real-world applications and popular libraries.


  - title: Configuration and Best Practices
    text: >
      Review TypeScript configuration options, declaration files, JSDoc integration, and best practices for organizing and maintaining TypeScript projects at scale.

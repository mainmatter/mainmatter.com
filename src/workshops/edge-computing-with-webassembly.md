description: 1-day workshop – This hands-on workshop teaches how to build such efficient, portable, and secure server-side applications using Rust and WebAssembly.
introduction: <p>Your backend services are working, but they're not thriving. Docker containers feel heavy, cold starts are slow, and your cloud bill keeps climbing. Security concerns keep you up at night, all while you’re fighting the spaghetti-stack to deliver features on a tight deadline. You've heard WebAssembly is the future, but it seems confined to browsers - can it solve your server-side problems?</p><p>Yes it can! WebAssembly is starting to power anything from safety-critical embedded applications to large-scale web services. Employed correctly it gives you microsecond cold boot times, reliable sandboxing, safe user extensibility, and much more.</p><p>In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to build such an efficient, portable, and secure server-side applications using Rust and WebAssembly. We’ll cover everything from foundational concepts to cutting edge features and by the end, you’ll have built a microservice in Rust, compiled it to WebAssembly, and deployed it using cutting-edge tooling. You’ll understand when this approach outshines containers, where the technology is headed, and how to incorporate these techniques into your existing infrastructure.</p>

topics:
  - title: Foundations
    text: >
      We start by introducing the basic concepts and building our first WebAssembly HTTP handler in Rust, from setup to deployment.


  - title: Building Real-World Services
    text: >
      We then expand on our basic HTTP handler, looking at different Wasm runtimes, deployment options, and common backend patterns in WebAssembly.


  - title: Advanced Topics
    text: >
      No production application is complete without tools to debug it. We will look debuggers, performance profiling tools, as well as monitoring solutions. We finish off by building expanding our HTTP handler yet again and - with everything we learned - build a simple calculator API service.

## Customised to your team’s needs

We're happy to customize the workshop to precisely fit your team's specific needs or challenges. If you have a very specific branching model or infrastructure or your team frequently struggles with particular aspects of Git, we can adapt the focus of the workshop more towards these aspects or cover additional topics as necessary.

All content and examples of the workshop are available publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/mainmatter/git-workshop).

title: Rust for the Web
format: 2-3 days on-site or remote
description:
  <p>Rust has become one of the most popular new programming languages in recent
  years. The combination of performance on the level of C++ with stability and
  security on the level of managed languages like C# or Java is attractive to
  many development teams.</p><br> <p>This workshop provides a smooth entry into
  the language for teams that are looking for leveraging Rust's capability in
  their web projects. We will teach everything you need to know about the
  language and wider ecosystem to be able to write your own HTTP server in the
  end!</p>

topics:
  - heading: What is Rust
    text: >
      A quick intro into what Rust is, how it came to life and what its core
      values are.
  - heading: Installation
    text: >
      We will go over Rust's main three CLI tools (<code>rustup</code>,
      <code>cargo</code> and <code>rustc</code>) and how to install them.
  - heading: Variables
    text: >
      We will have a look at regular variables, immutable variables, constants,
      scoping, and shadowing.
  - heading: Basic Types
    text: >
      In this stage we will take a look at Rust's fundamental types such as
      boolean, numbers, and characters.
  - heading: Functions
    text: >
      If we only had variables, then applications would be somewhat boring. This
      stage will teach you all about writing reusable functions in Rust.
  - heading: Compound Types
    text: >
      Rust not only offers built-in basic types, but also compound types like
      structs, tuples, enums and others which will be covered in this stage.
  - heading: Control Flow
    text: >
      Besides <code>if</code> conditions, as well as <code>for</code> and
      <code>while</code> that most developers are familiar with, we will learn
      about topics like pattern matching and the built-in <code>Option</code>
      and <code>Result</code> enums in this stage.
  - heading: Error Handling
    text: >
      This stage goes into depth on error handling, building on what was learned
      about the <code>Result</code> enum in the previous stage.
  - heading: Ownership and Borrowing
    text: >
      The ownership and borrowing model is a significant aspect of Rust and the
      main reason for the security guarantees it makes. We will look at a few
      basic examples and exercises to ensure these basic rules and mechanisms
      are well understood.
  - heading: Documentation
    text: >
      Rust has a built-in documentation generator and in this stage we will see
      how we can take advantage of that to document our own code.
  - heading: Testing
    text: >
      Unit tests, integration tests, documentation tests... after this stage,
      participants will be able to write all of them with comfort.
  - heading: Strings
    text: >
      Rust has a few different types of strings, and each serves a different
      purpose. This stage will give a basic understanding of when to use which
      type.
  - heading: <code>impl</code>
    text: >
      During this stage, we will look at how to associate functions with
      structs, basically creating methods.
  - heading: Traits
    text: >
      Traits are a little like interfaces in other languages in that they allow
      to define functions that are implemented by multiple different types. We
      will see how custom traits can be defined, what traits are built into the
      standard library, and how they can be automatically derived.
  - heading: Iterators
    text: >
      <code>for</code> loops in Rust are more powerful than you might think. In
      this stage, we will implement custom iterators that can then be used in
      regular <code>for</code> loops.
  - heading: Generics
    text: >
      Generic data structures and behaviors that work with a range of concrete
      types are a powerful mechanism for structuring code. This stage introduces
      Rust's generics and how to use them.
  - heading: Modules
    text: >
      Putting all code in one file is not great, so Rust provides modules as a
      way to split and organize code. We will take a look at inline modules,
      file-based modules, visibility specifiers and other related concepts.
  - heading: Cargo
    text: >
      Carge is Rust's build and package management tool. This part will explain
      the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, how to add dependencies to projects, and
      finally how to publish crates to the public crates.io package registry.
  - heading: The <code>std::fs</code> module
    text: >
      The Rust standard library provides a few APIs to interact with the file
      system. This stage covers reading and writing files, as well as performing
      other operations like copying files or creating folders.
  - heading: Macros
    text: >
      This stage of the workshop will give a high-level overview of what macros
      are and how to leverage them for your own code.
  - heading: CLI
    text: >
      Rust is great for building command line applications, not just because of
      the fast startup time, but also because the APIs in the standard library
      are well-thought-out and there are plenty of third-party crates that make
      developers' lives easier.
  - heading: Serialization and Deserialization
    text: >
      In this stage we will take a look at how data can be serialized and
      deserialized between formats like JSON and regular Rust structs.
  - heading: Networking
    text: >
      This section will give an introduction into building HTTP networking
      applications with Rust. <strong>At the end, you will have built your own
      simple HTTP server!</strong>

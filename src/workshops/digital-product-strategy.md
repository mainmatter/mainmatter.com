topics:
  - heading: Understanding the product
    text: >

      performance indicators (KPIs). We also develop personas to gain a better
      understanding of who we are building this product for
  - heading: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
    text: >
      Collaboratively strip down features and develop an understanding of the product's core functionality. The MVP is the sole focus for the rest of the exercises in the workshop
  - heading: User-flow diagram
    text: >
      Create a visualization of every step of the journey the user takes from the entry point to the final interaction
  - heading: Low-fidelity wireframes
    text: >
      A two-dimensional skeletal outline of key moments of the user flow diagram. Also called a fat marker sketch because it is made with such broad strokes that adding detail is difficult or impossible. The goal is to focus on communicating the concept rather than creating a detailed solution.
  - heading: Product architecture
    text: >
      Create a diagram to overview the web application's architecture.
  - heading: Next steps
    text: >
      To wrap up, we hold a presentation going over our results from the workshop. We include a report with a digital version of the user flow diagram, wireframes for MVP, the product architecture diagram, and our [40-page Playbook](/playbook/)

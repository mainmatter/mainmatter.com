Interface inventories are a key first step to create alignment and advocate transitioning to using design patterns in an organization. To get the most out of this workshop, bring in a cross-disciplinary team – we encourage people from every department that builds your product to join. Designers, developers, project managers, business owners, QA – are all welcome. These are the benefits of having an interface inventory:

- Gain clarity regarding which design components make up a digital product
- Help us analyze inconsistencies between them
- Gain buy-in from stakeholders to establish a design system
- Start a conversation with your team on how to refactor design with a
  pattern-based approach
- Use it as a blueprint for a pattern library

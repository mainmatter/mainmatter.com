One of the first steps in creating a design system is to conduct an interface
inventory. An interface inventory gives us a categorized overview of which
components make up our digital product.

Benefits of an interface inventory:

- Gain clarity regarding which design components make up a digital product.
- Help us analyze inconsistencies between them.
- Gain buy-in from stakeholders to establish a design system.
- Start a conversation with your team on how to refactor design with a
  pattern-based approach.
- Use it as a blueprint for a pattern library.

Interface inventories are a key first step to create alignment and advocate
transitioning to using design patterns in an organization. To get the most out
of this workshop, bring in a cross-disciplinary team – we encourage people from
every department that builds your product to join. Designers, developers,
project managers, business owners, QA – are all welcome.

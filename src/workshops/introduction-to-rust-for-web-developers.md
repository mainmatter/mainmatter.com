title: Introduction to Rust for Web Developers
format: "Workshop: 2-3 days"
subtext: "Bookable for teams â€“ on-site or remote"
description: <p>According to the Stack Overflow survey, Rust is one of the most
  beloved programming languages. In recent years, it has also gained popularity.
  There has never been a better time to become familiar with Rust! Learning a
  new programming language is always easier when you start with topics within
  your comfort zone. In this workshop, we will explore the main concepts of Rust
  by developing web applications. We will cover topics such as ownership and
  borrowing, concurrency, types and structs, all while building a real-world web
  app together. If you have a basic understanding of creating web back-ends and
  APIs, this workshop will get you up to speed with Rust.</p></br>

  <p>This workshop is designed for software developers with little to no
  experience in Rust. We recommend having prior experience in writing web
  applications.</p>

topics:
  - heading: Getting Started
    text: >
      We will begin by creating a new project and writing our first lines of
      Rust code. You will become familiar with new syntax primitives, basic
      types, expressions, function signatures, and the async/await syntax.
      Additionally, you will learn how to work with Rust's tooling, such as
      Cargo and Rust Analyzer.
  - heading: Ownership and Borrowing
    text: >
      As we add more functionality to our application, we will explore Rust's
      unique approach to memory management: Ownership and Borrowing. We will
      delve into the intricacies of this system by examining common situations
      and understanding how it requires us to rethink application development.
  - heading: Shared Access in Concurrent Applications
    text: >
      Rust's memory management system is ideal for shared access to data in
      multi-threaded applications, as it forces us to reconsider how we handle
      shared memory. In this section, we will learn how to share state across
      threads, how synchronization primitives function, and the significant role
      ownership plays.
  - heading: Structs, Traits, Serialization and Deserialization of Data
    text: >
      In the final part, we will gain insight into Rust's type system by
      exploring traits and their applications in serializing and deserializing
      requests and responses.

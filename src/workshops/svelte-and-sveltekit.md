title: Svelte & SvelteKit
format: 2-3 days remote or on-site
description:
  <p>Svelte is great choice for building fast and light-weight web applications.
  Its unique approach of generating reactive code at compile time instead of
  relying on a runtime, moves work out of the browser and results in highly
  efficient code. Combined with SvelteKit, it enables engineers to build large
  applications with ease while being able to choose among patterns like SPA,
  MPA, SSR, SSG on a per-route basis.</p> <p>This workshops takes participants
  through the entire process of building a complete, real-world application and
  teaches the theoretical concepts along the way. Each topic is introduced via
  an in-depth presentation followed by a practice exercise. We are happy to
  customize the workshop for the specific needs of a team and cover topics like
  performance, debugging, or any topics particular to a team's application.</p>
  <p>All examples and practical assignments from the workshop are available
  publicly on GitHub.</p>

topics:
  - heading: Svelte Basics
    text: >
      Rendering reactive UIs is the core functionality of Svelte. We cover
      Svelte’s unique approach to reactivity, the <code>$</code> syntax and its
      template language. We then look into writing Svelte components, accepting
      props, and its CSS scoping feature.
  - heading: SvelteKit Basics
    text: >
      This stage introduces SvelteKit, the project framework built on Svelte. We
      cover project creation and management, SvelteKit’s file system as well as
      creating and managing pages.
  - heading: Routing
    text: >
      We’ll dive deep into SvelteKit’s file based routing, loading and
      displaying data as well as topics like route grouping, route params and
      redirects.
  - heading: Testing
    text: >
      SvelteKit comes with two testing strategies: Vitest for testing components
      in isolation and Playwright for end-to-end testing. We cover both in depth
      and present approaches for testing real applications.
  - heading: Stores
    text: >
      This stage kicks off with an introduction of what stores are and how they
      work. We continue with looking into implementing the three main stores:
      writable, readable, and derived.
  - heading: SvelteKit as a server
    text: >
      The final stage of the workshop teaches how to implement progressive
      enhancement with forms. We cover how to send data to an API, how to
      validate forms, what server folders are, and give a brief introduction
      into hooks. We close by looking into how to implement authentication.

    text: >
      Highly integrated and automated infrastructure and workflows are the foundation
      that successful engineering teams excel on and Git is what drives them at their
      core. We'll look at branching models, Pull Request based workflows, and
      reviewing.

      Once we understand how Git fits in to the bigger picture, we'll look into how it
      works at its core and the building blocks it consists of. We'll cover what
      blobs, trees and snapshots are and understand how they represent a repo's
      history over time.
  - heading:  Branching and Merging
    image: /assets/images/resources/workshops/effective-git/git-branch.svg
    text: >
      Git makes branching easy and cheap and working with Git means constantly
      switching branches and merging them back together. We'll look at common
      branching and merging scenarios and understand what fast-forward merges and
      3-way merges are.
  - heading:  Rewriting History

    text: >
      Keeping a clean history and organizing commits in meaningful ways is essential
      for efficient collaboration on code bases. We will cover (interactive) rebasing
      and rewriting history including squashing, editing and dropping commits.
  - heading:  Bisecting

    text: >
      Sometimes it's hard to find the change that introduced a particular defect and
      Git Bisect can be of great help in identifying the respective commit. We look at
      how bisecting works and how it can be used to save a lot of time in common
      scenarios.
  - heading:  Open Q&A

    text: >
      We reserve some time in the end to discuss your team's specific questions
      relating to Git or infrastructure, tooling and automation around it.

Although Git is everyone's version control system of choice, it can sometimes
seem overwhelming and cause developers headaches instead of supporting them in
their work.

In this one day workshop, we explore the fundamental concepts of Git and via
hands-on exercises focused around day-to-day tasks show how to get the most out
of it.

## The Workshop

The workshop covers all relevant aspects of Git in just enough detail to be able
to efficiently use it day-to-day without being overwhelming or overly academic.
We focus on real challenges developers face when working with Git and give them
the understanding of the foundational concepts as well as practical guidance to
overcome those challenges. The workshop is split into several blocks that each
include a presentation that introduces a topic, followed by an exercise to apply
the learnings hands-on with the support of our trainers.

## Customized to your team's needs

We're happy to customize the workshop to precisely fit your team's specific
needs or challenges. If you have a very specific branching model or
infrastructure or your team frequently struggles with particular aspects of Git,
we can adapt the focus of the workshop more towards these aspects or cover
additional topics as necessary.

All content and examples of the workshop are

title: "Testing in Rust: going beyond the basics"
format: 1 day, on-site or remote
description: |
  <p>No application is an island: you need to interact with third-party APIs, databases and who knows what else. 
  Testing those interactions is tricky, to say the least! 
  This workshop will focus on expanding your Rust testing toolkit, going beyond the basic techniques 
  you're already familiar with. At the end of the session, you'll have a strategy to test most of the scenarios 
  that are relevant for a complex Rust application.</p>
  <p>The workshop is designed for software developers who have a good understanding of Rust's basic
  concepts and want to move beyond the built-in testing toolkit. <br>
  If you are new to Rust instead, you might be interested instead in our 
  <a href="/services/workshops/an-introduction-to-testing-in-rust/">introductory testing workshop</a>.</p>

topics:
  - heading: What is a test?
    text: >
      We will take a look under the hood to understand how the Rust built-in
      testing framework works. Armed with this knowledge, we will explore the
      runtime implications of different approaches for test organisation. We
      will also cover alternative test  runners, such as
      <code>cargo-nextest</code>.
  - heading: "Test isolation: filesystem"
    text: >
      All tests in Rust share the same filesystem as the underlying host, a
      problematic situation when multiple tests want to interact with the "same"
      files or touch directories that could affect the behaviour of the system
      they are being executed from.  We will explore various techniques to
      manage this scenario, including the  <code>tempfile</code> crate.
  - heading: "Test isolation: the database"
    text: >
      The database is another shared resource that can cause problems when
      running tests in parallel. We will explore how to use Docker to run an
      isolated database instance for each test, and how to use the
      <code>sqlx</code> crate to manage the database lifecycle.
  - heading: Mocks, stubs and fakes
    text: >
      In order to isolate the behaviour of a system under test, it is not
      unusual to replace some of its dependencies with "fake" implementations.
      We will explore the different types of fakes and how to use them in Rust.
      We will review, in particular, the <code>mockall</code> crate and the
      testing implications of using generics and dynamic dispatch for
      polymorphism.
  - heading: HTTP mocking
    text: >
      It is undesirable to have tests that hit real HTTP endpoints from
      third-party APIs, for a variety of reasons. We will explore how to use the
      <code>wiremock</code> crate to shield our tests from the outside world and
      make assertions on the HTTP requests that are being sent.
  - heading: Snapshot testing
    text: >
      Snapshot testing is a technique that allows us to capture the output of a
      system under test and compare it with a previously saved version. It is
      quite useful when working with complex data that might change frequently,
      such as HTML or error messages. We will explore how to use the
      <code>insta</code> crate to implement snapshot testing and manage the
      snapshots lifecycle.
  - heading: Executing logic before and after a test run
    text: >
      It is often desirable to execute the same logic before and after each test
      in our suite. We will explore a variety of techniques to achieve this,
      from a bespoke <code>#[test_case]</code> procedural macro to a custom test
      harness (via <code>libtest_mimic</code>).
  - heading: Black-box testing
    text: >
      We will combine everything we have learned so far into an easy-to-use
      setup that allows you to run black-box tests against a real database
      and a real HTTP server, without having to orchestrate multiple
      commandsâ€”just <code>`cargo test`</code> and you are good to go!

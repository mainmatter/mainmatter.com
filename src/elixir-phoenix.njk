      <p>Elixir combines the expressiveness and simplicity of Ruby with the performance and stability of the Erlang VM. Phoenix
        builds on the concepts first introduced by Ruby on Rails, combining them with a number of architectural improvements to
        take the architecture into the future.</p>

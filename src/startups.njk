        There are lots of reasons that a team gets overextended – lack of people, lack of expertise, or even lack of time.
        At Mainmatter, we’ve built a team of diverse expertise in web and cloud projects that deliver with a fresh perspective. We support our clients with experienced people who are ready to build products, mentor people and support your goals.

        We’ll work with you to make the products you need to make your business better. From developing a rock-solid concept to providing customer-centric UI to building the whole MVP, Mainmatter has an experienced team of product builders. We’re a one-stop shop for founders, scaleups, and SMEs in making their digital products (better) – from strategy to design to implementation.

        Updating your codebase shouldn’t stop your development in its tracks. With Mainmatter, you can take on legacy code and leave your technical debt behind – all while your team stays focussed on the roadmap. Our experts can take on the whole upgrade from the reviewing, planning and implementation – at a cost advantage over a complete rewrite later down the line. And we only call it a job well done when we leave your team with the know-how to keep up with future versions.

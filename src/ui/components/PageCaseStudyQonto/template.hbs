    <h3>
      The Challenge
    </h3>
    <p>
      After successfully raising a series B round, Qonto’s frontend engineering team realized they needed more people
      and knowledge to keep up with the ambitious goals that came with that. They needed to bring in senior experts to
      be able to release new features in the Ember.js based banking UI following an ambitious timeline. With the very
      fast growth of the company, the team also faced a number of impediments that impacted velocity and output quality.
      Qonto decided to reach out to simplabs to help them get back on track to sustainable growth.

    <h3>
      simplabs’ Approach
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our engineering consultants met with Qonto's team on-site in their office in Paris to kick off the collaboration.
      We sat down with the relevant stakeholders to develop an understanding of their business, their technology,
      infrastructure, tools and processes. Next, we reviewed the Ember.js codebase and interviewed the frontend team to
      understand what the main challenges were. At the end of this process, we had a clear understanding of the status
      quo as well as the main obstacles the team was facing and the problem areas they were struggling with.

    <h3>
      Clearing the roadblocks
    </h3>
    <p>
      Having identified the top impediments we were able to take immediate action. In the first few weeks of the
      project, we migrated the application away from a legacy template language and moved it back on to standard
      Ember.js patterns. We also substantially accelerated the Continuous Integration build times (cutting them roughly
      in half) as well as fixed some instabilities which had previously led to flaky test results. Both of these changes
      led to an immediate acceleration of the team's velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then helped the team ship some mission critical features following ambitious timelines. Our experts spearheaded
      these initiatives, working closely with Qonto's in-house engineers. We ensured Qonto's team had a clear
      understanding of our implementations and would take ownership over these parts of the app once sufficiently
      advanced.

    </figure>
    <p>
      Besides helping the team ship, we also focussed on evolving the application's architecture as well as engineering
      infrastructure to sustainably accelerate development while improving and maintaining quality. We set up automated
      visual regression testing to prevent unintended changes to the product UI being released to production. We also
      put a system in place for tracking the application's bundle size to prevent size and performance regressions.
      Having that system in place led to a 25% reduction of the application's main bundle over 2 months. Lastly, we
      invested time and effort in setting up an advanced linting system that would identify bad patterns, unused
      translation strings and other pitfalls to minimize their negative impact.

    <h3>
      Empowering the Team
    </h3>
    <p>
      All of the work we did for Qonto was done in close collaboration with their in-house team. An important part of
      our work is always sharing our expertise and helping others develop deeper understandings of the tools they are
      using so they can be more effective with higher confidence. At Qonto, we conducted workshop on various topics as
      well as pair-programmed with their engineers and shared know-how via reviews.

    <h3>
      Decomposition
    </h3>
    <p typography:class="p">
      Large tasks become better planable and less risky when decomposed into smaller units. This applies to full products that should be broken down into an MVP and subsequent increments but also for finer grained development or design tasks.

    <h3>
      Transparent Communication
    </h3>
    <p typography:class="p">
      Transparent communication and decision making processes are key for successful projects. Channeling communication through tools makes it transparent to all stakeholders and keeps a persistent record of discussions and decisions which is critical in particular for remote teams.

    <h3>
      Self–Organisation
    </h3>
    <p typography:class="p">
      We believe the classic project manager role in an organisational anti-pattern and advocate for self-organised project teams. Close and direct collaboration between all stakeholders fosters alignment towards a common goal and is essential to a project's success.

            We established modern and idiomatic practices for developing mobile apps and helped Trainline's in-house engineering team internalize those through code reviews.

            In addition to supporting Trainline with engineering resources and expertise, we were able to help improve the engineering process by establishing and solidifying a sprint based approach. This resulted in more efficient prioritization and a better sense of progress by both engineers and management.

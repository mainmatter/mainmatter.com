      simplabs worked closely with Trainline’s in-house engineering team and built a mobile web app to accompany the

    <h3>
      Sustainable added value
    </h3>
    <p>
      Working closely with Trainline's engineering and product teams, we were able to deliver the first version of the
      mobile web app on time and budget, continuing to extend and improve it afterwards. Our experts also leveled up the
      team's experience and helped them internalize modern and idiomatic practices for developing web apps via pairing
      sessions and code reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to supporting Trainline with engineering resources and expertise, we were able to help improve the
      engineering process by establishing and solidifying an iterative approach. This resulted in more efficient
      prioritization and a better sense of progress for both engineers and management.

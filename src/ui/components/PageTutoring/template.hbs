      Reviews

      We can review our clients' code bases thoroughly and will prepare an extensive document, listing all of the problems weâ€™ve identified. For each problem we provide an explanation and background information, a path forward and a severity assessment that can help with later prioritization. We end the review with a meeting in which we present the findings, discuss questions and together with the client, lay out a plan of action.

      We have reviewed applications for various international clients in the past, covering technology stacks from Ruby on Rails to Ember.js and Elixir/Phoenix.

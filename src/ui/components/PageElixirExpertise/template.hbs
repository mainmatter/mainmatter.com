      Elixir combines the expressiveness and simplicity of Ruby with the performance and stability of the Erlang VM. Phoenix builds on the concepts first introduced by Ruby on Rails, combining them with a number of architectural improvements to take the architecture into the future.

      Together, Elixir and Phoenix form a modern and capable stack for building ambitious digital products of the future, based on an established foundation that has proven itself for decades.

        The greatest product designs are almost invisible—the experience is so simple and fluid, you can barely imagine how you'd do things without the product. The process to create such experiences is one of fast iterations, rapid prototyping and experimenting our way forward. It's the safest path to practical, elegant and profoundly useful digital products.

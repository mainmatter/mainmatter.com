          a modern UI for an open-source router firmware
        </h1>
        <p class="typography.lead">
          simplabsâ€™ expertise in developing Ember.js based applications helped us significantly to define and develop
          the new DD-WRT NXT user experience. It was impressive to see in what short time such a complex application
          leveraging a customer backend interface could be implemented. simplabs' work did provide the new foundation
          for our UI and our in-house development team greatly benefitted from their know how.

                  Shipping a single page app bundled with a router firmware is substantially different from serving it
                  via the open web.

                <p class="typography.body-text">
                  The first step for us was to understand the characteristic aspects of the
                  environment, like limited hardware capabilities and slow update cycles. We then came up with an
                  approach for the project based on Ember.js that was tailored to the particular requirements and
                  limitations of the use case.

                <p class="typography.body-text">
                  We completed the prototype implementation of the architecture in just over 6 weeks, defining the
                  structure for the application and establishing good Ember.js patterns. That prototype laid the
                  foundation for subsequent engineering efforts taken on by embeDD's in-house engineering team.

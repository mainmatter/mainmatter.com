                DD-WRT is a Linux based firmware for wireless routers. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, it now runs on a wide variety of models and is installed on millions of devices worldwide.

                When embeDD, the company behind DD-WRT, was looking to re-engineer the old web interface and put the project on a stable foundation that would support development efforts for the long term, they reached out to simplabs for guidance.

          Accommodating a special environment
        </h3>
        <p class="typography.body-text">
          Shipping a single page app bundled with a router firmware is substantially different from serving it
          via the open web.
        </p>
        <p class="typography.body-text">
          The first step for us was to understand the characteristic aspects of the
          environment, like limited hardware capabilities and slow update cycles. We then came up with an
          approach for the project based on Ember.js that was tailored to the particular requirements and
          limitations of the use case.
        </p>
        <h3 class="typography.headline-2">
          The Solution
        </h3>
        <p class="typography.body-text">
          We completed the prototype implementation of the architecture in just over 6 weeks, defining the
          structure for the application and establishing good Ember.js patterns. That prototype laid the
          foundation for subsequent engineering efforts taken on by embeDD's in-house engineering team.

        <h3 class="typography.headline-2">
          Enabling long term success
        </h3>
        <p class="typography.body-text">
          In order to enable the client to continue the project successfully and ensure it would be a long term success, we coached embeDD's engineers and reviewed their work for an extended period of time after handing over the project.

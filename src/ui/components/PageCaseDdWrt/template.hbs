        DD-WRT is a Linux based firmware for wireless routers. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, it now runs on a wide variety of models and is installed on millions of devices worldwide. When embeDD, the company behind DD-WRT, was looking to re-engineer the old web interface and put the project on a stable foundation that would support development efforts for the long term, they reached out to simplabs for guidance.

    <h3>
      The Challenge
    </h3>
    <p>
      While the DD-WRT firmare itself (and Open-WRT which it originates from) are technologically advanced, flexible
      and powerful, the configuration UI had not been treated with the same level of care over the years. It did not
      expose great yser experience and was based on outdated technological patterns and an architecture that lead to
      substantial complexity and maintenance effort. embeDD was looking to give the UI the same level of care and high
      quality that the firmware itself benefitted from.
    </p>

    <h3>
      The Solution
    </h3>
    <p>
      We recommended Ember.js as a powerful, yet stable foundation that would support the project for years to come.
      Ember's strong stability guarantees make it the perfect for a foundational project like this, that is built to
      last, potentially for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shipping a single page app bundled with a router firmware is substantially different from serving it via the open
      web. The first step for our experts was to understand the characteristics of the environment, like limited
      hardware capabilities and slow update cycles. We then developed an application architecture for the project that
      was tailored to the particular requirements and limitations of the use case and catered for infrequent updates,
      intermediate network outages and a UI that adapts itself based on the capabilities of the device.
    </p>
    <p>
      We implemented a prototype based on that architecture in just over six weeks, defining the structure for the
      Ember.js application and applying best practices of the framework . That prototype laid the foundation for
      subsequent engineering efforts taken on by embeDD's in-house engineering team. Accompanying the prototype, we
      established processes and infrastructure around deployment and customization, allowing embeDD to manage variants
      of the UI for different releases of the DD-WRT firmware specialized for specific router models and providers
      brands.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Enabling embeDD's Team
    </h3>
    <p>
      In order to enable embeDD to continue the project successfully without us and ensure it would be a long term
      success, we handed over what we built to their internal engineering team in a well-communicated process. We
      coached the clientâ€™s engineers and reviewed their work for an extended period of time to ensure they were familiar
      with the architecture, patterns and processes we established before taking over responsibility completely.

        DD-WRT is a Linux based firmware for wireless routers. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, it now runs on a wide variety of models and is installed on millions of devices worldwide.

                  When embeDD, the company behind DD-WRT, was looking to re-engineer the old web interface and put the project on a stable foundation that would support development efforts for the long term, they reached out to simplabs for guidance.

                  Accommodating a special environment

                <p class="typography.body-text">
                  Shipping a single page app bundled with a router firmware is substantially different from serving it
                  via the open web.

                <p class="typography.body-text">
                  The first step for us was to understand the characteristic aspects of the
                  environment, like limited hardware capabilities and slow update cycles. We then came up with an
                  approach for the project based on Ember.js that was tailored to the particular requirements and
                  limitations of the use case.

                  We completed the prototype implementation of the architecture in just over 6 weeks, defining the
                  structure for the application and establishing good Ember.js patterns. That prototype laid the
                  foundation for subsequent engineering efforts taken on by embeDD's in-house engineering team.

                  In order to enable the client to continue the project successfully and ensure it would be a long term success, we coached embeDD's engineers and reviewed their work for an extended period of time after handing over the project.

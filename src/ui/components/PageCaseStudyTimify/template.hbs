            Laying the foundation for future success
          </h3>
          <p class="typography.body-text">
            Timify had validated their business model with a prototype they had built in-house. As the business was growing though, it became clear the prototype wouldn't be a solid foundation for the future. They needed to re-engineer the entire system, making sure it allowed them to continue iterating fast without sacrificing quality.

          </h3>
          <p class="typography.body-text">
            We built the first release version of the new application for Timify in just over 4 months, allowing them to meet their internal deadlines. After the initial release, we joined forces with the client's in-house engineering team, teaching best practices and ensuring modern and idiomatic Ember.js patterns were followed. This way, we were able to ensure long-term success for Timify's in-house team, based on the foundation we had laid.

          <p class="typography.body-text">
            Our technology experts spearheaded several engineering efforts focused around premium subscriptions along with payment system integration, localization of the application in 15 languages and support for time zones. Timify's in-house team was able to take over these initiatives, iterate on the foundations we had laid and maintain the features over time.

            Building on a modern stack
          </h3>
          <p class="typography.body-text">
            Ember.js proved to be the right technology choice for an ambitious application like Timify that was built to last for years. The baked in conventions enable larger teams and applications to move fast without breaking things. Leveraging modern web technologies like SVG, we were able to achieve decent runtime performance even for large data sets. The json:api based server API allowed us to implement the client and server side of a feature concurrently.

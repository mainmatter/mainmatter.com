                Sustainably boosting Productivity
              </h3>
              <p>
                We take part in all engineering conversations with the client's team, pair with engineers on features and bugs and often prepare presentations and workshops around concrete problems the team faces. Through this approach, we are able to boost the team’s productivity in three ways; we add workforce to overcome the initial obstacles, we solve long-standing impediments making the development process more efficient, and we level up the in-house engineering team making their future work more impactful.

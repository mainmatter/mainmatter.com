All Ember addons come with the concept of a “dummy app”. This has been super
useful to test our addons and has even been part of the reason why we have been
able to support so many different versions of Ember from a single addon using
ember-try scenarios. This talk by Chris from EmberFest 2022, gives a bit of
detail on how things work with “classic” V1 addons and dummy apps and talks a
little bit about why this can’t work for new Embroider V2 addons.

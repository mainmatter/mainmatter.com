        Following the successful Embroider initiative, a path was opened to build Ember apps with
        Vite. This allows for instant rebuilds where teams are currently struggling from build times
        of multiple seconds that are affecting efficiency and velocity.

      <p class="body">
        Yet, switching to Vite may be challenging due to outdated Ember versions, addons, or
        patterns. Also, assigning teams to prioritize such upgrades, at the expense of slowing down
        feature work, is a tough sell at most companies, often leading to these tasks being
        neglected. Mainmatter is uniquely positioned to take on projects like that, with years of
        Ember experience and numerous upgrade projects under our belt. As the team behind the
        Embroider initiative and now the <a href="/ember-initiative">Ember initiative</a>, we
        understand the necessary changes, how to implement them for minimal disruption, and how to
        avoid potential issues.

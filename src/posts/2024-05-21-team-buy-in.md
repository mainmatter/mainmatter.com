Consultants get a bad rep sometimes, and often for good reason, specially due to powerful top tier consultancies involved in everything from privatization of public companies to disaster relief. They're everywhere these days.

Boutique, technical consultancies like Mainmatter are nothing like that, but still "consultant" is a title with plenty of loaded meanings and associations.

As our Engineering Manager, [Kevin Bongart](https://github.com/KevinBongart), puts it eloquently, the perception can be like:

"Ugh, leadership is bringing in a bunch of consultants from Big Co to audit the team and point out our inefficienciesâ€¦ this can't be good, right?"

In the team's view, consultants are bad news: audits, inefficiencies, and changes suggested by _outsiders_! The natural reaction is to resist the implementation of all adjustments, even positive ones.

The team would need a very good reason to be on board. And that's called team buy-in.

## Making sure we're welcome guests

Outsiders can be helpful, of course. External experience and a fresh view on things can be very useful. But, as with any collaboration, it's important to be aware of local context and history.

When starting with a new client, we're mindful that we're many times coming in as outsiders during a time of difficult change for them - be it in technical terms (changing stacks or merging systems, for example) or organizational ones, say when a team is expanding and re-organizing. And, as often happens, both things at the same time.

We discuss that with leadership, and different stakeholders who might be involved in bringing us, and try to work with them in preparing the terrain for the engagement.

## Happy path

When the client team is bought-in, we get an environment of trust, a sweet spot where we complement the client team seamlessly. 

Context and knowledge are shared proactively, affording us smooth onboarding. Once we have some recommendations to give, these are discussed constructively. Decisions on what to implement are naturally done in consensus.

A virtuous cycle ensues, where implementing changes is progressively faster and more effective, and ideas flow freely back and forth. Together we shift into continous improvement mode. Everybody wins.

So. Just how do you get buy-in?

## Get the team involved early on

The earlier the intention to bring us in is communicated, the better. Before even making a decision, hearing the team out and addressing any concerns is a very good idea. Building consensus regarding the engagement. 

Sometimes it's hard to get consensus, of course. But when dissenters have been heard in earnest, that goes a _long_ way towards getting people to [Disagree and Commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit).

## Who invites us

Some very successful engagements happened when we were invited by people from the tech or product teams, who are closer to where the action will happen. This can help a lot in getting buy-in.

When the invitation comes from the very top, it makes a huge difference when management goes the extra mile and talks to the teams that will directly be involved in and impacted by the engagement.

## Framing the engagement

_How_ the engagement itself is communicated is key.

### Assessments, not audits

Some of our engagements begin with [an assessment of a client's current state of tech and organization](https://mainmatter.com/services/strategic-advice/). This can be either a high-level x-ray, or a more specific analysis of a team or component. 

An assessment can be super-helpful for a client to find blind-spots, to get an independent point of view in the context of competing internal assessments, and overall planning for big changes.

As one might imagine, this is most successful when a team is willing to show what's under the hood in the tech stack, and behind the curtains in terms of team interactions and processes.

On the other hand, if a team perceives the assessment as an _audit_, a quality control inspection where blame is distributed and people eventually get in trouble, transparency will obviously suffer. 

And some discontent might start brewing, understandably. In turn, potential future interactions and collaborative work might be seriously affected. 

That's a very bad start for a long term relationship.

Hence, Mainmatter doesn't do audits. We offer blameless assessments as a resource to help teams plan their future work, possibly leading us to a fruitful collaboration down the line. 


### Collaboration, not intervention

In a similar fashion, when we augment a team (with engineers, architects, designers or managers, sometimes all of the above), we work hard to ensure this work is collaborative and not perceived as an intervention.

We're making suggestions, sharing knowledge and practices, pairing and planning together, constantly building consensus.

We're complementing the team until they no longer need us. 

### Alignment on scope

An engagement can take many shapes and forms. It can have a tightly bounded scope, like updating the runtime and dependencies of a given codebase, or a much broader and open ended one, as with continuous assessment of team processes and practices. Sometimes implementation work might be done in tandem with continuous assessment and counselling, too.

Whatever the scope, it needs to be clearly communicated as soon as it is known. People can become territorial over their work. Nobody likes someone looking over their shoulders nor receiving unsolicited advice. If there's a misunderstanding over the scope of our work, that's exactly how it'll feel to the client team.

## During the engagement

Client team buy-in involves accepting to hear recommendations from us, and for this to continue, our recommendations have to resonate and make sense.

Addressing pain points is a great way to ensure this relevance, and build trust. We're solving real problems, removing slogs.

Often we'll find issues that weren't raised before. Or ones where a priority and solution aren't yet agreed upon. In these cases, we study and discuss until there's enough consensus, and the team prioritizes it.

And then we help them implement it, as part of the team.

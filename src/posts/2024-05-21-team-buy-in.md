## Coming in as a consultant is a delicate matter

As with any collaboration, it's important to be aware of the context interactions are happening in.

Whenever engaging with a new client team, we're mindful that at first we're coming in as an outsider entity, likely during a time of difficult change, be it in technical terms (changing stacks or merging systems, for example) or organizationally, say when expanding a team or changing the team structure, and many times, both.

So it's crucial we earn the team's trust from the get go, in order for the collaboration to be successful. 

In other words, ideally we should get the client team to buy into the engagement before even starting.

### With team buy-in

We get an environment of trust, and we're able to work towards a sweet spot where we complement the client team, seamlessly. 

Context and knowledge are shared proactively, affording us smooth onboarding. Once we have some recommendations, these are discussed constructively. Decisions on what to implement are naturally done in consensus.

A virtuous cycle ensues, where implementing changes is progressively faster and effective, and ideas flow freely back and forth. Together we shift into continous improvement mode. We're set in a direction of highest positive impact.

Everybody wins.

### ...and without

We might still get results, but it'll be (a lot) harder and it'll take much longer.

The engagement might be met with subtle, and not so subtle, resistance and obstruction. Morale is hit on both sides. People might even leave, disgruntled, sometimes taking precious domain knowledge with them.

It's no fun for all involved. And bottom-line: the client gets less return over their investment.

## So how do you get buy-in?

### Get the team involved early on

The earliest decision makers communicate their intention to bring us in, the better. Before making a decision, hear the team out and address any concerns head on. Try to build consensus regarding the engagement. 

Sometimes it's hard to get consensus, of course. But when people feel like they have been heard in earnest, it goes a _long_ way towards getting their agreement to disagree but to commit.

### Who invites us

Some very successful engagements happened when we were invited by people from the tech or product teams, who are closer to where the action will happen. This can help a lot in getting buy-in.

When the invitation comes from the very top, it can be helpful walking the extra mile and talking to the teams that will directly involved be in the engagement.

### Framing the engagement

How the engagement itself is communicated is key, of course.

#### Assessments, not audits

Some of our engagements begin with an assessment [TODO: link to service] of a client's current tech and organization state. This can be either a high-level x-ray, or a more specific analysis of a team or component. 

An assessment can be super helpful for a client to find blind-spots, to get an independent point of view in the context of competing internal assessments, and overall planning for big changes.

As one might imagine, this is most successful when a team is willing to show what's under the hood in the tech stack, and behind the curtains in terms of team interactions and processes.

On the other hand, if a team perceives the assessment as an _audit_, a quality control inspection where blame is distributed and people eventually get in trouble, transparency will obviously suffer. 

And worse, resentment might brew, understandably. In turn, potential future interactions and collaborative work might be seriously affected. 

That's a very bad start for a long term relationship.

Hence, Mainmatter doesn't do audits. We offer blameless assessments [link?] as a resource to help teams plan their future work, possibly leading us to a fruitful collaboration down the line. 

We strongly advise our clients not to communicate our assessments as audits to their teams.

#### Collaboration, not intervention

In a similar fashion, when we augment a team (with engineers, architects, designers or managers, sometimes all of the above), we work hard to ensure this work is collaborative and not perceived as a mandated intervention.

Internal framing of augmentation work as such is key, as well. 

Otherwise, once we start the collaboration, it'll be an uphill battle earning the trust of our colleagues on the client side.

#### Alignment on scope

An engagement can take many shapes and forms. It can go from something tightly bounded like updating the runtime and dependencies of a given codebase, to something much broader like continuous assessment of processes and practices. Some times implementation work will be done in parallel with continuous assessment and counselling.

People can become territorial over their work. Nobody likes somebody looking over their shoulders and giving unsolicited advice. When there's a misunderstanding over the scope of our work, that's exactly how it'll feel like to the client team.

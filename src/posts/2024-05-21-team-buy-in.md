Consultants get a bad rep sometimes (and sometimes for good reason). 

As @KevinBongart puts it eloquently:

> "Ugh, leadership is bringing in a bunch of consultants from Big Co to audit the team and identify inefficiencies across the teamâ€¦ this doesn't sound good, right?"
>
> Of course this will look like bad news to the client's team. Audit! Inefficiencies! Changes suggested by _outsiders_! The team is going to resist the implementation of changes - even positive ones.
>
> They would need a very good reason to be on board... and that's called team buy-in.

## Reading the room

As with any collaboration, it's important to be aware of context and history.

When starting with a new client, we're mindful that we're coming in as outsiders, often during a time of difficult change - be it in technical terms (changing stacks or merging systems, for example) or organizationally, say when expanding a team or changing the team structure. And many times, both.

We discuss that with leadership, and ask that they try to first bring the team onboard with having us.

Ideally we'd like to get the team to commit to an engagement before it starts at all.

### Happy path

When the client team is bought-in, we get an environment of trust, a sweet spot where we complement the client team seamlessly. 

Context and knowledge are shared proactively, affording us smooth onboarding. Once we have some recommendations to give, these are discussed constructively. Decisions on what to implement are naturally done in consensus.

A virtuous cycle ensues, where implementing changes is progressively faster and more effective, and ideas flow freely back and forth. Together we shift into continous improvement mode. Everybody wins.

So. Just how do you get buy-in?

## Get the team involved early on

The earlier client decision makers communicate their intention to bring us in, the better. Before making a decision, hear the team out and address any concerns. Try to build consensus regarding the engagement. 

Sometimes it's hard to get consensus, of course. But when dissenters have been heard in earnest, that goes a _long_ way towards getting them to disagree and commit.

## Who invites us

Some very successful engagements happened when we were invited by people from the tech or product teams, who are closer to where the action will happen. This can help a lot in getting buy-in.

When the invitation comes from the very top, it makes a huge difference when management goes the extra mile and talks to the teams that will directly be involved in and impacted by the engagement.

## Framing the engagement

_How_ the engagement itself is communicated is key.

### Assessments, not audits

Some of our engagements begin with an assessment [TODO: link to service] of a client's current tech and organization state. This can be either a high-level x-ray, or a more specific analysis of a team or component. 

An assessment can be super helpful for a client to find blind-spots, to get an independent point of view in the context of competing internal assessments, and overall planning for big changes.

As one might imagine, this is most successful when a team is willing to show what's under the hood in the tech stack, and behind the curtains in terms of team interactions and processes.

On the other hand, if a team perceives the assessment as an _audit_, a quality control inspection where blame is distributed and people eventually get in trouble, transparency will obviously suffer. 

And some discontent might start brewing, understandably. In turn, potential future interactions and collaborative work might be seriously affected. 

That's a very bad start for a long term relationship.

Hence, Mainmatter doesn't do audits. We offer blameless assessments [link?] as a resource to help teams plan their future work, possibly leading us to a fruitful collaboration down the line. 

We strongly advise our clients not to communicate our assessments as audits to their teams.

### Collaboration, not intervention

In a similar fashion, when we augment a team (with engineers, architects, designers or managers, sometimes all of the above), we work hard to ensure this work is collaborative and not perceived as a mandated intervention.

Internal framing of augmentation work as such is key, as well.

We're complementing the team until they no longer need us.

### Alignment on scope

An engagement can take many shapes and forms. It can have a tightly bounded scope like updating the runtime and dependencies of a given codebase, or much broader and open ended, as with continuous assessment of team processes and practices. Sometimes implementation work might be done in tandem with continuous assessment and counselling, too.

Whatever the scope, it needs to be clearly communicated as soon as it is known. People can become territorial over their work. Nobody likes someone looking over their shoulders nor receiving unsolicited advice. If there's a misunderstanding over the scope of our work, that's exactly how it'll feel to the client team.

## During the engagement

Client team buy-in involves accepting to hear recommendations from us, and for this to continue, our recommendations have to resonate and make sense.

Addressing pain points is a great way to ensure this relevance, and build trust. We're solving real problems, removing slogs.

Often we'll find issues that weren't raised before. Or ones where a priority and solution aren't yet agreed upon. In these cases, we study and discuss until there's enough consensus, and the team prioritizes it.

And then we help them implement it, as part of the team.

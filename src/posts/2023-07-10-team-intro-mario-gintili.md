Hello world!

I'm Mario Gintili, a full-stack senior software engineer at Mainmatter. I'm
currently working in the medical education industry.

My coding journey started in high school. I loved puzzles and video games and
started learning Ruby on Codecademy. I took Coursera's startup engineering
course because I wanted to start my own company. I was also interested in game
development, dreaming of creating something like Metal Gear Solid.

A trip to the UK led me to Makers Academy. Their mission: learn Ruby on Rails in
12 weeks and get a software engineering job. I was in, got selected, and started
my professional journey. I chose Ember.js because it fits well with Ruby on
Rails in its MVC structure and convention-over-configuration approach.

Becoming a professional full-stack developer was a milestone. Building products
from start to finish and watching users interact with them was exciting. Working
at my first large-scale startup gave me the chance to work with top industry
professionals.

When not coding, I have a range of hobbies. I go to the gym and try out
different training methodologies(Hyperthropy, HIIT, LIST, Kettlebell-only,
Crossfit, etc). I enjoy cooking, video games, techno and its subgenres, and
hanging out with my cat, Nihil.

The programming journey has its challenges. Screen time and mental effort can be
taxing. It's essential to take breaks and maintain a balanced lifestyle.

Looking ahead, I'm excited about the opportunities in software development
consulting market. I plan to use Ember.js and Ruby to the fullest. I'm also
considering a dab into either Rust or Clojure.

Stay tuned for more ðŸª„

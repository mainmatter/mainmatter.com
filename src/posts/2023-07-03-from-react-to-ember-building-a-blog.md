  <p>Having a personal website has been on my to-do list for quite some time, but I always found myself stuck when answering the question, 'How do I start?' With countless frameworks and different tech stacks to choose from, the options seemed overwhelming. I've been working in React since I joined the company, but most of my colleagues are experts on Ember, so I wanted to learn more about it. I decided to use this project for that.
  I will share my journey, detailing the challenges I encountered and how I overcame them while comparing the development process between Ember and React.</p>

### You might want to read this if

- You would like to create your own website/blog (if you decide to use Ember.js
  maybe you can get ideas from here)
- You already know React, and you are curious about Ember.js.

## The start

In 2013, I embarked on my first blogging journey on Blogspot. It lasted for two
years, but as university life took over, my time became limited, and I gradually
lost touch with that blog. Nonetheless, I still longed for a space on the
internet where I could freely express my thoughts. As my career in the tech
world progressed, I knew it was time to build my own website.

The amount of different tools for creating a website and the fact that I had
never done one on my own before, felt overwhelming. I shared my issues with my
working colleague, Chris. From that day forward, we began scheduling weekly pair
programming sessions. Chris became my accountability partner and mentor,
bringing immense value to my journey. üíú

Working at a consultancy company like Mainmatter means that you don't always
collaborate with everyone on the team. Chris and I never had the opportunity to
work together on a client project. I really enjoyed having the chance to
collaborate with someone outside of my usual circle. As a junior developer,
these sessions have proven to be incredibly experienced member of the company,
these sessions have proven to be incredibly valuable for me.

and I in one of our pair programming sessions. This one was about improving the
performance of my website, so we were running lighthouse. Spoiler alert - not
efficiently rendering my photos was my big issue._

## From React to Ember

When I joined the company, I initially worked with React, and I was the only one
who didn't have experience working with Ember. This sparked my curiosity to
learn at least what it looked like.

Chris has been working with this framework for 10 years, so starting those pair
programming sessions with him seemed like the perfect way to start learning
Ember.

## Design Mockups

To me, designing a mockup of the website was an important step to kick off the
project. It helped me visualize my ideas of what I wanted the website to look
like. It got me learning a bit more about UI/UX, and I used Figma as a sketching
tool. I've worked with Sketch on other projects, but I still find Figma easier
to use and more intuitive. I collected some inspiration and colors I liked. Then
I started with the landing page, and I kept going from there.

Florian from our team (our design ninja) gave me a tip to use actual content on
my mockups instead of using the classic 'Lorem Ipsum' placeholders - you better
perceive the distance between the elements and how the font feels with your
text.

document of the mobile and desktop designs for my website._

## Coding

To begin the coding journey, I followed the
[quick start guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/).
I created my first route - an 'About Me' page, made my first component -
`<Header>`, and my first routes navigation Home ‚Üî About Me.

My first coding challenge was ‚Äò_How to create a dropdown in Ember?_‚Äô. (now I‚Äôm
having flashbacks from whenever I asked Chris _how do you do this in Ember?,_ he
would answer _There is no such thing as "in Ember". This is just javascript._
üòÜ)

As I transitioned from working with React to Ember, I noticed a shift in
thinking. Ember introduced me to the handlebars templating language and a
different project structure, where each component had its dedicated folder
containing adapters, controllers, models, and templates. It felt a bit
overwhelming initially, especially compared to React, where all the logic
sometimes resided in a single file.

Another challenge I encountered was finding updated documentation. When googling
my struggles, I often stumbled upon outdated resources or, in some cases, no
solutions at all. The Ember community, being smaller than the React community,
naturally had fewer online resources, which increased the learning curve for a
beginner like me.

Overall, my transition from React to an Ember project proved to be a valuable
learning experience, allowing me to explore new perspectives and expand my skill
set.

### First Coding Challenge

Picking up the question from my 1st coding challenge. I made that dropdown
üôåüèº¬†and here is what it looks like:

```handlebars
{% raw %} // dropdown.hbs
<div class="dropdown">
  <button
    class="dropdown-button {{if this.open 'focus'}}"
    type="button"
    {{on "click" this.dropdown}}
  >
    {{@title}}
    <img class="dropdown-icon {{if this.open 'focus'}}" />
  </button>
  <div class="dropdown-list {{if this.open 'show'}}">
    {{yield}}
  </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
```

```js
//dropdown.js
import Component from "@glimmer/component";
import { action } from "@ember/object";
import { tracked } from "@glimmer/tracking";

export default class Dropdown extends Component {
  @tracked open = false;

  @action
  dropdown() {
    this.open = !this.open;
  }
}
```

```handlebars
{% raw %} // header.hbs
<Dropdown @title="Blog">
  <LinkTo class="dropdown-text" @route="posts"> All Posts</LinkTo>
  <LinkTo class="dropdown-text" @route="posts.category" @model="travel">
    Travel</LinkTo>
  <LinkTo class="dropdown-text" @route="posts.category" @model="tech">
    Tech</LinkTo>
</Dropdown>
{% endraw %}
```

I mean, for someone coming from React, there was a lot of new stuff going on in
these two files.

Also, going back to using the `this.` keyword brought me memories from my
classes at university and how understanding this concept was the boss level of
object-oriented programming. üòÇ

Let me break down what is happening in my `<Dropdown>`:

_Note, I want to say that this is probably not the most helpful dropdown
component since I can only its title is customizable. In my case, I ended up not
reusing it, so I didn‚Äôt feel the need to make it more customizable._

- My dropdown component has a button that renders a
  {% raw %}`{{@title}}`{% endraw %}. In React, this would be the `props.title`.
- Then I have a `<div>` that will receive {% raw %}`{{yield}}`{% endraw %}. This
  was a new keyword for me as well. The yield acts like a placeholder, and if I
  use `<Dropdown>` in another component, which is the case in the _header.bhs_,
  what I pass within the open and closing tags of my component will be rendered
  in the place of{% raw %}`{{yield}}`{% endraw %}. The equivalent of this in
  React would be the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù property.
- In here
  {% raw %}`class='dropdown-button {{if this.open "focus"}}'`{% endraw %}, I‚Äôm
  dynamically changing the button class name so that when the open variable is
  set to true, I add ‚Äòfocus‚Äô to the class name, which is how I apply the yellow
  color to the dropdown title when the user opens it. Same happens with
  {% raw %}`<div class='dropdown-list {{if this.open "show"}}'>`{% endraw %}.
- Next, we have {% raw %}`{{on 'click' this.dropdown}}`{% endraw %}, this
  instructs my app to run the `dropdown()`function (defined in the _dropdown.js_
  file) after the user clicks on the button.
- Time to dive into _dropdown.js_ file associated to my component:
  - Pretty much all my components have these 3 imports in their javascript
    files:
    - `Component` is a class from the Glimmer library (DOM rendering engine made
      by the ember team) that allows me to define the behavior of my component
      and its UI logic. In the latest versions of React, functional components
      were introduced, meaning that they can be defined using regular JavaScript
      functions - this way, there is no need to extend a class from a Component
      base class.
    - `{action}` is a decorator coming from the `@ember/object` module. It is
      Ember's own object model, it allows me to define an event handler, in this
      case, the `dropdown()` function that gets triggered when the user clicks
      on the button. `@action` here works similarly to `bind()` in JavaScript -
      when I use `this.open` inside of my Dropdown class in the dropdown.js
      file, I need to find a way to make sure `this` refers to the same context
      as the one used in the template (Dropdown.hbs file), and `@action` does
      this for us. This way, when calling the `dropdown()` function from the
      template the right context (`this`) gets passed to it. React doesn't have
      decorators in their official API, we typically use regular functions as
      event handlers directly.
    - And the last import {% raw %}`{tracked}`{% endraw %} from
      `@glimmer/tracking`. This is a module provided by glimmer framework that
      tells my code to keep an eye on a variable, in my case, the variable
      "open". This way, my app knows that when the value of this property
      changes, changes in the UI will be triggered. In React, we typically
      achieve this functionality using the built-in state management and the
      `useState` hook. In my website this translates to - whenever a user clicks
      on the button, the value of the tracked variable changes, which controls
      the visibility of the dropdown's children and applies specific CSS
      classes.
- Finally, it's time to look at the last file - the template where I use my
  `<Dropdown>` component, **header.hbs.**:
  - I‚Äôm passing to the `<Dropdown>` a list of `<LinkTo>`. The latter component
    allows me to create a link to a route, while the `@model` argument, allows
    my app to know which data to retrieve when clicking on that route.

### Rendering My Blogposts

1. **Finding a tool to publish my posts**

   After giving the shape I wanted to my website, the question for one of the
   key features was: "How do I create a not-so-complicated system that allows me
   to publish blog posts? Am I going to create HTML pages every time?"

   Chris proposed an approach: "Let‚Äôs create posts using markdown files." He
   said we could use `ember-cli-showdown`.

   This addon converts my markdown into HTLM, so I don‚Äôt need to do the tedious
   & time-consuming job of writing an HTML file every time I want to publish a
   new post. It was a deal. ü§ù

2. **Combining my posts information with the tool**

   _"How can I extract what I write in my markdown files into my HTML
   templates?"_ Another plugin enters the room: welcome to
   [**Broccoli-Static-Site-Json.**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/broccoli-static-site-json)
   üëãüèº It generates a JSON API of the content of my markdowns. Let me guide you
   through the process:

   - I need to define what data will populate my JSON API and to do it, I define
     a ‚ÄòPost‚Äô model. It looks like this:

   ```js
   //app/models/post.js
   import Model, { attr } from "@ember-data/model";
   export default class PostModel extends Model {
     @attr title;
     @attr("date") date;
     @attr category;
     @attr description;
     @attr image;
     @attr content;
     @attr header;
   }
   ```

   Now that I have that defined, I need to tell the broccoli addon what
   attributes to use when building the JSON API.

   Let‚Äôs add that in `/lib/content-generator/index.js` (a file coming from the
   in-repo Ember addon that you can use to add broccoli-static-site-json to your
   project):

   ```js
   //lib/content-generator/index.js
   const postsTree = new StaticSiteJson("data/post", {
     type: "post",
     contentFolder: "data/posts",
     attributes: ["title", "date", "category", "image", "description"],
     collate: true,
   });
   ```

   I start by specifying the location of the API information, which, in my case,
   is stored in my markdown files located under 'data/post'.

   The 'type' parameter defines the name of the JSON:API document. The name you
   assign to the 'type' parameter gets pluralized, so for the next attribute, it
   should be 'data/posts'. Next, I define the attributes I want to include.
   Additionally, I utilize the last configuration variable, `collate`, which
   allows me to query all of my content at once, using 'findAll'. This is
   particularly useful when I need to retrieve all posts. Now, let's move on to
   the fun part üôåüèº - creating a template that will structure the information
   from the markdown files. We'll then utilize our newly created API to populate
   the template. To exemplify this, I'm going to show my `post-preview`
   template:

### What they see

![Post Preview Component](/assets/images/posts/2023-07-03-from-react-to-ember-building-a-blog/post-preview-component.png)_`<PostPreview>`component_

### What I see

```handlebars
{% raw %} //app/components/post-preview.hbs
<article class="blogpost-preview">
  <div class="blogpost-header">
    <Category @icon={{@post.category}} @text={{@post.category}} />
    <LinkTo
      class="link"
      aria-label="Read more about {{@post.title}}"
      @route="posts.post"
      @model={{@post.id}}
    >
      <h1><span>{{@post.title}}</span></h1>
    </LinkTo>
  </div>
  <div class="blogpost-body">
    <p class="blogpost-description">{{markdown-to-html @post.description}}</p>
    <PolaroidImage
      @src="../../assets/images/{{@post.image}}"
      @description="post created on {{format-date @post.date}}"
    />
  </div>
</article>
{% endraw %}
```

And this is the frontmatter of the markdown file for that blogpost preview:

```yaml

title: How I Built This Website
category: tech
description: "<p> I‚Äôm so happy to see a project of my own being out there. </p>
<p> Today, I wanted to look back and see how this started and how it went.
It has been a long ride that is still going on - right now, I‚Äôm starting to focus on improving the performance of my website (a topic for a later post üòâ). </p>
<p> I learned a lot about design, UI sketching tools, like Figma, and a new JS framework for me - Ember. </p>
<p> I deployed a website for the first time üôå¬† and I got to fix the challenges that may come with it. </p>
Perhaps this can be useful for someone that is also interested in start creating their own corner in the internet."

---
```

This is information that all the posts will have - title, category, description,
image and date. I‚Äôm keeping this as Frontmatter (metadata in Markdown files)
because when my markdown is being converted into static JSON, each of my
frontmatter keys will become keys in the JSON API. This way, I can access their
data from my templates, e.g {% raw %}`{{@post.category}}`{% endraw %} ,
{% raw %}`{{@post.image}}`{% endraw %}.

## Deploying

‚ÄúOk, I have the main functionalities running and my design is more or less close
to what I sketched, time to make it public üò±‚Äù. It is very easy to fall in a
situation where we say to ourselves that a project is still not ready to be
shipped. There was a moment where Chris made me wear my Product Manager hat, and
told me: "Write down the minimum features you need to make it functional till
you deploy it‚Äù. This help me prioritize what I really needed and keep my focus.

I got myself a domain at [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and I used
[netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy it.

I faced some challenges with the deployment:

1. Image fingerprinting The photos were not loading on the deployed website.
   Why? Ember was adding a hash to my photo sources, e.g - from ‚Äòwork-in-cv.jpg‚Äô
   it would become ‚Äòwork-in-cv-h4323524hgs.jpg‚Äô. In my HTML the photo source
   would still be the one without the hash, but that path would not exist
   anymore. How did I fix it? I specified on ember-cli-build what type of files
   I wanted to get fingerprinted:

```js
//ember-cli-build.js
module.exports = function (defaults) {
  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    // Add options here
    fingerprint: {
      extensions: ['js', 'css', 'map'], //remove photo formats from here
    },
  }
}
```

2. Routes were not found

Ember is a SPA (Single Page Application)- it loads a single HTML page and then
dynamically updates its content as the user interacts with the application
without requiring full page reloads from the server each time. Therefore SPA
websites provide a smoother user experience.

The downside of this approach is that if we directly request to the web server a
specific URL, e.g., /blog/post, the server won't find a file at the specified
path and responds with a 404. This happens because the server is only aware of
the index page and serves this page for all URLs within the application. It is
Ember's JavaScript code that takes care of rendering the appropriate content
based on the requested route.

To handle direct URLs requests to the web server, there are two approaches:

1. Creating HTML files in the paths of the routes.
2. We tell Netlify to give us the index.html when we get a 404 error, and Ember
   decides what page we will render.

I chose the first solution - it is better for content websites, and we want SEO
(Search Engine Optimization).

To help me with this, let me introduce another addon,
[**Prember**](https://github.com/ef4/prember). You just need to tell Prember
which URLs you want converted into static HTML websites, and the addon does it
for you in build time.

Here is how I specified them:

```js
//ember-cli-build.js
const fs = require("fs");
let posts = fs.readdirSync("data/post").map(file => {
  return `posts/${file.replace(/\.md$/, "")}`;
});

module.exports = function (defaults) {
  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    prember: {
      urls: ["/", "/about-me", "/contact", "/posts", ...posts],
    },
  });
  return app.toTree();
};
```

How do I keep Prember aware of the URLs of my posts (since I‚Äôll keep adding new
ones)?

I built a function to help me with this, which you can see in the code above:

```js
//ember-cli-build.js
let posts = fs.readdirSync("data/post").map(file => {
  return `posts/${file.replace(/\.md$/, "")}`;
});
```

I create a posts array that is populated with all the files I have under
data/post directory. I make some changes before I save it to my array, the files
there look like this _working-from-cv.md_, I remove the _.md_ and I attach
_posts/_, so at the end I have an array of the URLs to my posts that look like
this _posts/working-from-cv_.

Now, I just need to add the array containing all the URLs to my posts with all
the other URLs for the other pages -
`urls: ['/', '/about-me', '/contact', '/posts', ...posts]`, with `‚Ä¶posts`,
javascript will deconstruct my array and add its values to the urls array.

## My Thoughts About This Project

Seven months have passed since I released it.

After I deployed it, I made some improvements, primarily related to the
performance. By running Lighthouse, I saw that my biggest issue was not being
efficient when loading my images. I recently added a little reaction button at
the end of my posts. (inspired by Josh Comeau's website).

I don't have a long experience in web development, so for me, going from react
to ember it wasn't the smoothest transition as I found Ember a bit harder. I
guess every framework has its pros and cons. In React, dealing with component
states can become messy; in Ember, you don't need to care about it. In Ember,
having all these separate files that target the same page can create confusion -
controllers, .js, .hbs. However, some people prefer this approach. In the end,
choices like these are very subjective.

Ember has a more traditional approach to object-oriented programming. It
resembled what I learned at university way more.

Regarding the type of project I built - a personal website/blog. I might be
falling into the group of the people who create a blog and never post on it. üôà
I think I put a lot of pressure when I start working on a post, and I made them
very long - this adds friction to posting regularly. Also, when I designed how
to present the information, I just kept long posts in mind.

My pieces of advice are: choose a publishing tool that is easy enough - the
markdown files approach is working well for me; when sketching your website,
keep short posts in mind as well.

Since almost every human is an internet user nowadays, it is nice to have your
own website where you can share your work and interests - you can end up meeting
more people with the same interests as you and possibly initiate cool work
collaborations.

It was rewarding to learn and use my current knowledge to create a website that
would match my personality: it felt like decorating a house. üòÜ I started by
collecting inspiration from other websites, then I sketched how I wanted the
pages to look in Figma, and finally, I started coding. Having the sketches in
the first place helped me a lot throughout the process although they were not
pixel-perfect. I also realized that some design choices were harder to implement
than I thought, so I kept embracing some improvisation. üòÖ

my journey building the project. What are your thoughts about having a personal
website? Feel free to reach out to me with feedback or to discuss about this

  <p>For the first hearing, it was surprising and challenging how a visual designer can start open-source projects. As an applied art service provider/ex freelancer, everything started with a client or project requirements and the number of projects that I did for myself just for fun was significantly shrinking, especially as a beginner father. At Mainmatter everyone spends 20% of their time as an active member of the open-source community, so I had to find a solution.</p>

## The idea

Among the fields I have experience in, Branding and UI/UX seemed the best choice for starting a new open-source project. 
The idea came quickly: I decided to create Branding and UI/UX Templates for fellow designers. In the past months, I have dedicated one day of my work week, my "20% time", to the conception and realization of this project and I will be showcasing the results in this post.

## The journey & experience

After getting used to rules and requirements, at first it felt kind of
strange to have all the freedom of the world - I can do anything I want as long as
the results are interesting and motivating for others.

At this point, I had a voice in my head - that most of the designers would hear
I assume - "Let’s imagine a fictional client or project that I have to find a
solution for". Instead of this, I thought: "What if I turn the whole process upside
down and create something based on my gut feelings, combine surprising elements
together as a montage, that is functional meanwhile, and see what comes out of

The first concept became boring (I won't show it to anybody) I became a bit
skeptical about my idea. But instead of giving up, I realized what I want.
Extraordinary. Surprising. Anything but boring.

## Concept 2

I was searching between Google fonts when I found the most ridiculous and
strange but well-designed font I've ever seen called "Nabla". I knew I have to
start something with this, let's see if it is even usable for anything or if it
is only a joke. I don’t think I've ever would suggest this to a client in a real
situation, so here is the time to find out if it is good for something. This was
the point when things became interesting. I started to combine the font with
beautiful cloud illustrations, and soft and warm color tones and kept the
balance with Circular Std font which is a wonderful quality font with strong
geometric types.

Based on the overall impression I decided to use some professional Chinese
street photography which was super hard to find, but after hours of searching
stock photography, I found what I was looking for. After this it was obvious to
try some traditional Chinese typography (what I never did before), it was very
satisfying and mega fun. I'm quite happy with the overall result, can be ideal
for a fashion brand with a young target group for the Chinese market, or any
other market with some strong connection to China.

## Concept 3

Berlin is an amazing inspiration for creative people even a poster on the street
can be a good start of something great, this is how Concept 2 was born. I
decided to play around with brutal geometric shapes and patterns, with strong
but not too saturated colors.

​The Larken font immediately seemed a good combination here, I remembered for if
from the past, it is a very special bohemian, font between modern and classical,
elegant and crazy. Fits just perfectly. The brutal geometric shapes required
some smaller details for balance, I found a package with interesting bug
illustrations which I modified to make all the bugs symmetrical to fit better in
the concept. This idea has quite versatile usage of course the illustration
package can be changed to match specific cases.

## Concept 4

Extremely condensed fonts were always something I wanted to try on the web but
never had a chance to do, so Concept 4 seemed just the perfect time for it.
After finding the ‘Rama Gothic C’ font which I considered the most well-designed
in this category, started to test different concepts and how can I make the best
out of it. It turned out a slideshow-style website combines colorful surfaces
with typography playfulness and amazing monochrome photography with
center-aligned overlay color circles, highlighting some important parts of the
image. I will be curious to try further different concepts with the ‘Rama Gothic
C’ font.

## Conclusion

It was very useful for me to experience the freedom of the creation of ‘Branding
templates’ without any rules or requirements and it’s strongly motivating to
suggest braver and more outstanding elements in real-life projects as well. I
hope these templates will be just as much useful and fun to work with - or
implement further - for the designer community, as it was for me. I’d gladly
offer these as open-source projects.

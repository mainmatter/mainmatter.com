  <p>For the first hearing, it was surprising and challenging how a visual designer can start open-source projects. As an applied art service provider/ex freelancer, everything started with a client or project requirements and the number of projects that I did for myself just for fun was significantly shrinking, especially as a beginner father. At Mainmatter everyone spends 20% of their time as an active member of the open-source community, so I had to find a solution.</p>

## The idea

Among the fields I have experience in, Branding and UI/UX seemed the best choice for starting a new open-source project. 
The idea came quickly: I decided to create Branding and UI/UX Templates for fellow designers. In the past months, I have dedicated one day of my work week, my "20% time", to the conception and realization of this project and I will be showcasing the results in this post.

## The journey & experience

After getting used to rules and requirements, at first it felt kind of
strange to have all the freedom of the world - I can do anything I want as long as
the results are interesting and motivating for others.

At this point, I had a voice in my head - that most of the designers would hear
I assume - "Let’s imagine a fictional client or project that I have to find a
solution for". Instead of this, I thought: "What if I turn the whole process upside
down and create something based on my gut feelings, combine surprising elements
together as a montage, that is functional meanwhile, and see what comes out of

The first concept quickly turned boring and I started feeling a bit
skeptical about my idea. But instead of giving up, that brought me closer to what I really wanted.
Extraordinary. Surprising. Anything but boring.

## Concept 2

I was searching among Google fonts when I found the most ridiculous but
well-designed font I've ever seen, called "Nabla". I knew I had to
start something with it.
I don’t think I would ever suggest using a similar font to a client in a real-world
situation, so this project was the perfect opportunity to experiment with it.

Here things became interesting: I started to combine the font with
captivating cloud illustrations, focusing on using soft and warm color tones while maintaining the
balance with Circular Std font which is a wonderful quality font with strong
geometric types.

Based on the overall impression I was getting from the design, I decided to use some professional Chinese
street photography. It was hard to find exactly what I was looking for, but after hours of searching through seas of stock photos, I finally came across the perfect pictures for this project.
These naturally led me into
trying some traditional Chinese typography (which I never did before). It was very
satisfying and lots of fun. 

I'm quite happy with the overall result and I believe it would look great
for a fashion brand with a young target group within the Chinese market, or any
other market with a strong connection to China.

## Concept 3

Berlin is a costant inspiration for creative people. Even a poster on the street
can turn into something great: this is how Concept 2 was born. 
I
decided to play around with brutal geometric shapes and patterns, with strong
but not too saturated colors.

​The Larken font immediately seemed a good fit here. I remembered this font
from the past work: it is a very special bohemian font, between modern and classic,
elegant and crazy. 
The brutal geometric shapes required
some smaller details for balance so I found a package with some interesting bugs
illustrations which I modified to make them symmetrical and complement
the concept better. 

This idea has a quite versatile usage and of course the illustration
package can be changed to match specific contexts.

## Concept 4

Extremely condensed fonts were always something I wanted to try on the web but
never had the chance to. Concept 4 seemed just the perfect time to experiment with them.
After finding the ‘Rama Gothic C’ font which I considered the most well-designed
in this category, I started to test different concepts.
My idea quickly turned into a slideshow-style website combining colorful surfaces
with typography playfulness, and wonderful monochrome photography with
center-aligned overlay color circles, highlighting important parts of the
image. I will be curious to try further different concepts with the ‘Rama Gothic
C’ font.

## Conclusion

It was very useful for me to experience the freedom of the creation of ‘Branding
templates’ without any rules or requirements and it’s strongly motivating to
suggest braver and more outstanding elements in real-life projects as well. I
hope these templates will be just as much useful and fun to work with - or
implement further - for the designer community, as it was for me. I’d gladly
offer these as open-source projects.

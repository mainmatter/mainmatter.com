Joel Marcey, Director of Technology at the Rust Foundation, and Marco
Otte-Witte, Founder of Mainmatter, discuss the benefits and disadvantages of
Rust and how to pitch it to decision-makers. Joel also talks about the Rust
Foundation’s goals and his role within it. He goes on to share success stories
from companies such as 1password, KDAB, Tweede golf, and Meta.

Marco and Joel then review Rust’s benefits, including safety, efficiency, and
security, and highlight its stability and reliability improvements that allow
developers to catch whole classes of errors at build time instead of runtime.
Joel also mentions the productivity and maintainability gains that people
typically see when switching to Rust and Marco points out how the more dynamic,
untyped languages, that are typically used in web development, all go back to
types for that exact reason.

Finally, the conversation shifts to the topic of pitching Rust adoption to
decision-makers. Joel explains that Rust is now typically already in the
conversation whenever a language is chosen and that it’s always crucial to be
upfront about the disadvantages of Rust, like the steep learning curve, and to
make clear what use cases it is not suitable for, like frontend web development.
Lastly, Joel highlights the importance of focusing on Rust’s stability,
security, and significant operational cost reduction due to its efficiency, when
pitching.

  <p>
  Ember apps from version 3.28 to the latest can now be built with Vite. Community addons must get ready for the change. How many of them are already V2? How many are still V1 but should be compatible with your Vite app? How many still require some work? And which ones rely too much on classic-build semantics and should be replaced with a different Vite-compatible solution? As part of Mainmatter <a href="/ember-initiative/">Ember Initiative</a>, our team performed an audit of the most popular community addons to get a picture of where the community stands at this time.

Mainmatter started the [Ember Initiative](/ember-initiative/) and made Vite support our team's first goal. We released [ember-vite-codemod](https://github.com/mainmatter/ember-vite-codemod) to help you get your app ready for Vite as easily as possible. One blocker you may encounter though relates to the addons you use. If your app depends on a classic addon that is incompatible with Vite, you will be stuck in the classic-build world.

To get an overview of how important the risk is for Ember developers to be blocked by classic addons, we audited all the top 100 addons on [Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/) and started to sort them out: Which are already v2 and fully compatible? Which classic ones should be compatible with Vite? Which ones need rework? And last but not least, which ones rely too much on classic-build semantics and should be abandoned in favor of a different solution?

This blog post presents the result of this audit, and one thing we must say is they are... very promising! ðŸŽ‰

## We made half of the way

At the time of writing, about 56% of the most popular community addons provide a V2 format or a basic npm package solution. The community did a fantastic job at bringing the whole ecosystem to the modern world! If your app depends on popular addons like `ember-concurrency`, `ember-page-title`, `ember-power-select`... fear no more, all these addons provide a V2 format and should continue to work the same way once you start building with Vite.

You can view the exhausitve list of the top-100 Ember addons that provided a V2 format or became basic npm packages last time the audit script was run (April 17th) on the GitHub issue [embroider-build/embroider#2288](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/2288#issuecomment-2713639700).

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: More community addons that don't belong to the top-100 may also have been converted to V2. If you want to check an addon metadata with only one command instead of searching for the repository, run `npm view <your-addon-name>@latest ember-addon` in a terminal. V2 addons have the metadata `version: 2`. If the command doesn't return anything, it might have been converted to a basic Vite-compatible npm package that is not properly an Ember addon, or there might be a subtlety with the repository structure; double-check on GitHub.

## V1 addons may just work

Just because your app depends on a V1 addon doesn't mean you'll necessarily have a problem once you start building with Vite. This is because Embroider does its best to maintain the compatibility under the hood. When your app builds, `@embroider/compat` tries to rewrite the V1 addons into Vite-compatible static packages, and unless there's something in your addon that deeply rely on Ember classic semantic, it should work.

There is a bunch of V1 addons in the top 100 we don't specifically worry about, because they are used in the Vite app blueprint, or they have passing `embroider-optimized` tests, or we received positive feedback from developers saying they could get them work with Vite. Some other addons are more uncertain because their CI doesn't run `embroider-optimized`, or they seem to rely at least partially on Ember classic semantic. In any case, we will need help from the community to check if all these addons can be used seamlessly once building with Vite.

That being said, the fewer v1 addons you have, the faster your initial build and rebuilds will be.

## The case of ember-test-selectors

[ember-test-selectors](https://github.com/mainmatter/ember-test-selectors) is an interesting example of how a classic addon can evolve. It's structure has been reworked to a monorepo that now provides two public packages:

- `ember-test-selectors` will remain a classic addon. Embroider rewrites it correclty and it keeps working once you start building with Vite, so you don't need to care about it before your migration.

- `strip-test-selectors` is a new basic npm package that provides the two AST transforms `ember-test-selectors` relies on. If you want to start using `data-test-*` in your Ember Vite app or if you want to get rid of the compat step for performance, you can configure `strip-test-selectors` directly in your Babel config, you no longer need `ember-test-selectors`.

## The case of FastBoot

FastBoot brings Server Side Rendering (SSR) to your Ember apps using mainly two addons: `ember-cli-fastboot` and `fastboot-app-server`. In the very big lines, when `ember-cli-fastboot` is installed in your Ember app, you have the possibility to build it for client (code runs in a browser) or to build it for SSR (code runs in a node environment), and both build outputs are slightly different. Along with deploying the build for SSR somewhere, you install `fastboot-app-server` on the server side, and you point it to where the build is so it can consume it and serve the requested pages.

Long story short: today, you can't migrate your FastBoot app to Embroider+Vite, the work to make it work hasn't been achieved yet.

[Vite has its own way to bring SSR in apps](https://vite.dev/guide/ssr.html#server-side-rendering-ssr) that modern apps should rely on. In the migration path considered by the Ember core team, `ember-cli-fastboot` would be deprecated in favor of a new way to tell Vite to build the SSR version of the app, to generate a build that can be correctly consumed by `fastboot-app-server`. There are still blockers to set this migration path ready though. For instance, one relates to modules resolution in the Node environment, another one relates to the local development part that depends entirely on the ember-cli express server which disappears completely with Vite because the dev server is Vite dev server.

FastBoot migration path is currently not included in the Ember Initiative because other issues have a higher priority. We could include FastBoot if the initiative receives enough support to make it possible. [Get in touch with Mainmatter](/contact/) if your company has a high interest for this issue.

## The case of Webpack

Webpack and Vite are both bundlers that web apps can rely on for similar purposes. If your app is a classic Ember app building with ember-cli and using ember-auto-import, or if it uses the previous version of Embroider (`@embroider/webpack`), then at least part of your build is being done by Webpack. That's the reason why ember-auto-import and `@embroider/webpack` allowed you to custimise the Webpack options (but didnâ€™t give you full control).

The Ember community choosed Vite as the default for new modern Ember apps, and running ember-vite-codemod to migrate to Vite will automatically remove `webpack` from your dependencies. If you were using a custom Webpack config through Embroider build options or ember-auto-import to perform actions on your build pipeline, you will need to rethink these functionnalities. In general, there shouldn't be anything you do with Webpack that you can't achieve with Vite.

For instance, if you used Webpack to configure some CSS processing, you can refer to Vite documentation to [reimplement something equivalent](https://vite.dev/config/shared-options.html#css-postcss); or if you used Webpack to include Node.js polyfills browser-side as documented in [ember-auto-import README](https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/tree/main/packages/ember-auto-import#global-is-undefined-or-cant-find-module-path-or-cant-find-module-fs), you'll need to rework this part, or look into new ways to add them via the Vite config. Though this is technically possible, note that [Vite official documentation discourages this practice](https://vite.dev/guide/troubleshooting#module-externalized-for-browser-compatibility) because of the impact it has on the bundle size.

## Addons to remove and migration paths

`broccoli-asset-rev`, `loader.js`, `ember-cli-app-version`, `ember-cli-clean-css`, `ember-cli-dependency-checker`, `ember-cli-inject-live-reload`, `ember-cli-sri`, `ember-cli-terser`, `ember-template-imports` and `webpack` are dependencies included in the classic app blueprint that are no longer used in Vite. If you use `ember-vite-codemod` to partially automate your migration, these dependencies will be automatically removed.

Additionally, a few classic addons rely too much on classic-build semantics and should be replaced with a different Vite-compatible solution. Foreach of these addons, our team made sure there is a migration path to point you at:

- `ember-fetch` behaves a way that is incompatible with modern JavaScript tooling, including building with Vite. To remove ember-fetch dependency, you can check out https://rfcs.emberjs.com/id/1065-remove-ember-fetch and see recommended alternatives.

- `ember-composable-helpers` contains a "won't fix" Babel issue that makes it incompatible with Vite. The current way to solve this problem is to move from the original `ember-composable-helpers` to `@nullvoxpopuli/ember-composable-helpers`. Checkout the first section of the repository's README: https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-composable-helpers.

- `ember-cli-mirage` doesn't work correctly with Vite. The recommendation is to move to `ember-mirage`. Checkout https://github.com/bgantzler/ember-mirage/blob/main/docs/migration.md for guidance.

- `ember-css-modules` behavior is incompatible with Vite, you should migrate to a different solution to manage your CSS modules. Mainmatter team worked out a recommended migration path that you can follow for a file by file migration to ember-scoped-css, which is compatible with Vite. Checkout https://github.com/mainmatter/css-modules-to-scoped-css or our [dedicated blog post](https://mainmatter.com/blog/2025/03/28/migrate-from-ember-css-modules/).

- `ember-cli-typescript` is deprecated. The app blueprints combined to `ember-cli-babel` configuration include everything you need to use TypeScript in your application. See [ember-cli-typescript README](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript) to read about the migration path.

## Conclusion

Thanks to Ember community enthusiasm and hard work, most popular Ember addons are V2, or at the very least Vite-compatible once rewritten by Embroider: the path to Vite is wide open. As part of the Ember Initiative, our team provided you with many tools and migration guides you can rely on to bring your app to the modern world.

Do you rely on v1 addons that don't belong to the top 100? Do you need guidance to make them compatible with Vite or find a migration path like the one we built for ember-css-modules?

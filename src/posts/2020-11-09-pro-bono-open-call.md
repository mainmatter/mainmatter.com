## Seeking applicants for pro-bono product design

simplabs is a digital product consultancy with an emphasis on sustainable
success. We have a proven track record of successful projects for international
clients, ranging from startups to Fortune Global 500 enterprises. To learn more
about our approach, take a look at our [services](/services/digital-products/)
and [Playbook](/playbook).

### Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is welcome to apply

In an effort to support the creation of an equal playing field, we invite
applicants from **underrepresented groups in tech** to apply for pro-bono
product design. We especially invite and welcome women, Black, Indigenous &
People of Color, QTIBIPOC/LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities, and people
facing economic or social hardships.

We will offer one of the following services:

- **Product strategy (moderation of a 2-week design sprint):** we will work with
  you and your team to validate an idea in a 1-week design sprint, and then
  iterate and improve on that idea on the following week. At the end of the 2
  weeks, you will have a tested prototype of an idea for your product, which you
  can show to potential users or investors as well as an understanding of how to
  move the idea forward. This service is ideal for teams that have a product and
  design team, and who along with the decision-making team are able to work with
  us remotely for the entirety of two weeks. It is also a great kickoff for an
  MVP project.
- **Design system strategy and kickoff:** we will have a workshop consultation
  for the transition of your digital product into a design systems methodology.
  The consultation will include technical implementation suggestions and the
  inventory of your existing interface. After that, our product designer will
  mentor your team for 3 weeks, collaborating to create the initial design
  structure and an organizational workflow to optimize collaboration between
  your team. At the end of this period, your team will be knowledgeable on how
  to successfully work with a design system.

## Criteria

- From an underrepresented diversity group in tech (underrepresented groups
  include: women, Black, Indigenous & People of Color, QTIBIPOC/LGBTQIA+ people,
  people with disabilities, and people facing economic or social hardships)
- In a European time zone
- In need of product design support
- Comfortable having our project featured on our website and social media
  channels
- Willing to share the project on their social media

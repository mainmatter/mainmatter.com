Chris has been at simplabs for three years now and is the number one expert when
it comes to EmberJS. His passion for open source even made him start a Twitch
channel, where he likes to stream once a week, sharing his knowledge with other
members of the Ember community.

Outside of work, Chris is a loving father to two wonderful kids and enjoys
playing the piano.

In Inside simplabs, we take you behind the scenes and interview our team
members. They share valuable insights on their jobs as well as their personal
interests, hobbies, and goals.

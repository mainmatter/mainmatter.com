Qonto reached out to simplabs looking for a combination of added engineering
power and outside expertise to help their in-house engineers improve, we call
this [Team Augmentation](/services/team-augmentation/).

This method of working sees our technology experts merge with our client's
in-house engineering teams to share their know-how. simplabs engineers spearhead
and guide new development initiatives while establishing best practices and
transferring knowledge to in-house engineers on the job via reviews and pairing
sessions.

Just as with previous Team Augmentation projects like
[trainline](/cases/trainline/) this approach brings "double value for the
client" says simlpabs CEO Marco Otte-Witte, "short term value is added by the
client immediately gaining more engineering power, but additional long term
value is added through improved architecture, code quality, processes and
leveled up in-house engineers."

simplabs engineers Tobias Bieniek and Ricardo Mendes who are both Ember.js core
members are working on the Qonto project. They started by analyzing Qonto's code
and found the templates were using the rather antiquated Emblem.js which nobody
was really happy with but was difficult to migrate away from. To tackle this
Tobias created and open sourced
[emblem-migrator](https://github.com/simplabs/emblem-migrator/) which Qonto and
all other Emblem.js users can now use.

Next simplabs engineers identified that Qonto's test suite speed was impeding
progress. They showed Qonto's engineers how to analyse the underlying causes and
then half the testing time.

Both migrating away from Emblem.js and halving the test suite running time
happened in the first week!

simplabs CEO Marco Otte-Witte says "I'm really pleased that simplabs have been
able to add so much value in such a short amount of time proving that our team
augmentation method works. We're all looking forward to continuing the project
and helping Qonto to succeed in their highly competitive market."

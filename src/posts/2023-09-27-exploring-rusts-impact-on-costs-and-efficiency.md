According to Marco Otte-Witte, Founder of Mainmatter, and Stefan Baumgartner,
Senior Product Architect at Dynatrace, Rust allows developers to write more
stable software with fewer maintenance issues and higher efficiency, resulting
in cost savings for companies. In the interview, Stefan shared his experience
introducing Rust to Dynatrace’s platform, and how they delivered a functioning
prototype within a few days for a particular use case. Ever since, his
team at Dynatrace has been able to maintain and run the Rust-based product
smoothly with minimal issues, proving that Rust is a stable and efficient
language for their projects.

The conversation then moves to Stefan's personal experience with programming
languages and his journey to learning and teaching Rust. He discussed his
background with languages like C, C++, and C# and his first transition to web
development with JavaScript.

Stefan highlights the importance of understanding memory management and
low-level concepts when programming, which Rust enforces and guides programmers
through. He debated how teaching Rust to others, especially those familiar with
dynamic or scripted languages, brings a fresh perspective and empowers
developers to write efficient and reliable software. Learning Rust may be more
challenging for those already accustomed to certain concepts like automatic
garbage collection, as they need to adapt to a new way of dealing with
obstacles. Therefore – Stefan explained - it is important to provide learners
with concrete problems to solve when teaching Rust and encourage them to work
towards a goal.

Lastly, Stefan discusses different timelines from his own experience and
suggested that having mentors and guidance throughout the learning process is
essential for success in Rust due to its explicit decision-making requirements
and complex concepts.

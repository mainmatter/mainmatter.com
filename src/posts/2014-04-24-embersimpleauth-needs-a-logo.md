The project needs a logo.

<!--break-->

Every good open source project needs a nice and shiny logo these days. It would
be great if Ember.SimpleAuth had one as well. As I’m not really an expert in
these things it would be great if some of the more artistic advanced
contributors/followers could
[contribute something](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/152)!

## Build vs. Hire

Why decide if you can benefit from both? - Augment!

When building a technical team, there are two main options: You can build your
own team from scratch or hire a ready-made one. Each approach has its pros and
cons that can significantly impact your project's cost and efficiency. However,
there is also a third option: You can get external help while you build internal
capacity/capability.

## Building Your Own Team:

#### Building your own tech team involves hiring individuals, onboarding, and making them work as a team.

This process can be challenging and time-consuming. Finding the right people
with the **necessary skills** and **experience** isn’t always easy, and
establishing a fully functional team can take several months. Training and
onboarding programs may be required to align the team with the project's goals
and the company's processes and technologies.

#### The recruitment process alone represents a significant cost for companies.

Job postings, application processing, interviews, and other related activities
require both time and financial resources. On average, it costs six to nine
times an employee's monthly salary to replace them and train a newly hired
employee. Supervisors' valuable time spent monitoring the training progress must
also be considered. (add source)

#### The new hire needs the proper infrastructure to be able to start working.

Additionally, companies must invest in infrastructure and provide the necessary
resources for their newly hired team members.

#### There’s a bookkeeping difference.

Working with externals is a cash expense, while hiring is an ongoing expense in
the books/long-term commitment.

## Hiring a Ready-Made Team:

#### Alternatively, you can opt to hire a ready-made tech team.

This often involves collaborating with an agency that specializes in assembling
teams of experienced professionals who have already worked together and have a
proven track record of successful project delivery. This approach offers several
benefits.

#### Hiring a ready-made team can be more cost-effective and time-efficient.

Firstly, agencies have already invested in recruiting and onboarding their team
members, eliminating the need for individual hiring and training processes. As a
result, you can save significantly on recruitment and training costs.
Additionally, ready-made teams are generally well-versed in working together,
which can lead to increased efficiency and a shorter time to market.

#### Opting for a ready-made team may mean sacrificing some degree of control.

While you can still communicate your project requirements and provide guidance,
you may have limited influence over the team's composition and processes.

#### You are at risk for a long-term dependency.

If you don’t have and don’t build up internal capability, you’ll be fully
dependent on the agency.

## A Hybrid Approach: Team Augmentation

### Gradually build internal capacity while leveraging the expertise and efficiency of external professionals.

Instead of first hiring and assembling the team and waiting until they are
established enough to build a product, you can work with a partner that augments
your team.

You can start building while hiring and establishing your own team in parallel.
By working closely with a partner, you can bridge the gap between your current
internal capabilities and the requirements of your project. Furthermore, you
build up internal capability and eventually will be able to continue without the
partner.

#### You can also build on something you have no prior experience with yourself.

Team augmentation is a great way to get started with new technologies. Through
methodologies like Pair-programming, mentoring, and strategic support, we at
Mainmatter help you to make the right tech stack decision, train your team and
build the product at the same time.

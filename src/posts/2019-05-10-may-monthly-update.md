## News

#### Samanta de Barros joins simplabs

We’re very excited to announce that
[Samanta de Barros](https://twitter.com/sami_dbc) has joined simplabs.

Samanta started out her career as a .Net and Java developer before shifting her
attentions to Ember and Rails as she preferred the agility of web applications.
Her work as a consultant helped Samanta to build experience with many different
types of companies. She has shared this experience in talks at events including
EmberConf and JSDay Uy. Watch Samanta's EmberConf talk "Let's Test that Addon!"

Our CEO Marco says _“I'm very happy to have Samanta on board. Her expertise with
both Ember.js and Rails as well as experience with consulting international
clients and as a public speaker make her a great fit to our team and we all look
forward to working with her.”_

#### ember-intl-analyzer released

Yet another cool tool to emerge from out work with [Qonto](https://qonto.eu/en)!

The ember-intl-analyzer CLI tool analyzes your app code and finds unused
translations for you and will soon provide warnings for missing and broken
translations too.

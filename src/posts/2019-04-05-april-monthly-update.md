## News

#### Florian Pichler joins simplabs

We're very excited to announce that
[Florian Pichler](https://twitter.com/pichfl/) has joined simplabs.

Florian’s career has varied from user interfaces and print design to frontend
development but what ties his entire career together is a strong focus on user
experience.

He has a wealth of experience doing consulting work around new technologies and
both native and web-based apps. In this work he has helped to shape, design and
bring to life projects for Audi, BMW, Microsoft, Zurich Insurance Group and many
more.

Florian also speaks at events about design and development and is also a
maintainer for [BookPlayer](https://github.com/TortugaPower/BookPlayer), a free
and open source iOS app for audiobooks.

Our CEO Marco says _"I'm very happy to have Florian on board. His expertise in
both the engineering and design fields as well as experience working with big
corporate clients make him a valuable addition to the team and will allow us to
bring more value to simplabs clients in the future."_

Equally as exciting is our new client Qonto, a Paris based VC funded Fintech
startup who are “the ideal banking alternative for freelancers, startups and
SMEs.”

Qonto reached out to simplabs looking for a combination of added engineering
power and outside expertise to help their in-house engineers improve. We call
this [Team Augmentation](/services/team-augmentation/) and you can read the full
annoucement [here](/blog/2019/03/29/qonto-project/).

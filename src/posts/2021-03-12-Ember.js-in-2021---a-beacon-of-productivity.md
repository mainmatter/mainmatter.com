Ember has been around since the early days of the frontend renaissance that
already started several years ago by now. It's almost a decade old and dates
back well before React, Vue, Svelte and all the others. The framework has never
been on the forefront of the frontend hype train but quietly enabled teams to
ship steadily and sustainably ‚Äì among them [Qonto](https://qonto.com) and
[CLARK](https://clark.de), two of Europe's
[Top 50 FinTechs](https://thefintech50.com/the-fintech50-2020) in 2020 (more on
their success with Ember below).

In this post, I want to make the case for Ember in 2021 and explain why I
consider it a beacon of productivity in the middle of a roaring sea of
complexity. While everyone is obsessed with change and innovation (often
mistaking the former for the latter), Ember allows teams to excel at executing
their product vision and focus on shipping instead of getting lost in low-level
rabbit holes where little business value is to be found.

### simplabs ‚ù§Ô∏è Ember

To be completely transparent, I'm heavily biased towards Ember. With simplabs, I
founded what is now the
[leading Ember consultancy in Europe](/ember-consulting/). We've helped many
teams successfully build, evolve and maintain large applications with Ember over
the years. Some of our team members are involved in the Ember core team and we
maintain a number of widely adopted libraries in the ecosystem.
[We're one of the official sponsors of the framework even](https://emberjs.com/sponsors).
With all that experience and also some experience with teams using other
technology stacks, I think we do have a view on frontend development that's
maybe a bit different from other teams' views and because of that, it is worth
sharing.

## The Status Quo of Frontend Engineering

There have been huge amounts of progress in the frontend engineering world over
the past 10 years or so. Back when Ember was first released,
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (and sometimes even
[Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/)) were still the go-to solutions for making
otherwise static and server-rendered pages dynamic. And while jQuery remains
[the most used JavaScript library on the web to date](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/javascript_library/all/q),
techniques introduced first by Ember and Angular.js (and later React and others)
are now widely accepted and adopted. While frontend engineering was something
that many _"real"_ developers would look down on only a few years ago and that
was often merely an afterthought, the field has been professionalized
significantly and now gets the attention it deserves. That does not only
acknowledge the fact that frontend development is hugely challenging but also
its significance for businesses due to the direct impact on the end users'
experience.

Things haven't slowed down in the world of frontend development though. In fact,
quite the opposite ‚Äì we are seeing innovation and change at an extremely high
and seemingly still accelerating pace. JavaScript has become the
[world's dominant language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)
and is the default answer many developers have to just about anything they might
be dealing with on the web
([you can even write your CSS in JS now üôÄ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS-in-JS)).
And while innovation and exploring possibilities and new approaches are great,
the fact that a huge community of developers is collectively on the lookout for
the next big thing and everyone is only waiting to jump on the next bandwagon
does more harm than might be apparent at first glance. It's easy to
underestimate the cost that comes with the churn that adopting new approaches
over-eagerly brings with it which is often only to realize later the hype train
has changed direction again and what you bet on has now turned into a dead-end.

### The Complexity Fetish

I think that complexity is fetishized in the frontend world in a way ‚Äì mainly
due to two sentiments. One is simply ego. As the virologists and epidemiologists
say (and we all have learned in the past year), _"there's no glory in
prevention"_. And just like that there's (surprisingly) little glory to be found
in steadily shipping real product value based on solutions to common problems
others have found before you and encoded in frameworks based on strong
conventions. On the other hand, there's all the engineering glory to be found in
figuring out the best‚Ñ¢ way to address a particular problem and taming low-level
complexity even if all that work is not contributing to executing on a product
and business vision ‚Äì taking on such problems is often done for the glory alone,
regardless of whether the problem has been solved before or even poses a
challenge in the respective project at all. Having ported a React app step by
step from Redux over MobX to hooks and beyond over the course of the past few
years likely was an exciting engineering journey and came with a whole bunch of
interesting and challenging work. However, the cost-benefit relationship of all
the time spent on the endeavor might be questionable.

[Chris Manson](https://simplabs.com/blog/author/real_ate) from the simplabs and
[Ember Learning Core](https://emberjs.com/teams/) teams recently told me the
story of an engineer he was talking to at a conference. They understood and
completely agreed with the value that Ember provided as a full-featured,
batteries included frontend application framework that enables teams to build
skyscrapers starting from the 20th floor instead of beginning with laying the
foundation. Yet they said they would never propose the framework to their boss
because then they wouldn't get to write as much code for solving low level
problems they found particularly exciting because _"Ember does it all for you"_.
While that **can** be a valid reason not to choose a technical solution at
times, in most cases shipping **is** important and should be the main driver for
decisions.

The other sentiment that I believe contributes to the complexity fetish is a
desire to be in control of ever every single aspect and detail of one's app.
That might be driven partly by the Node community's ‚Äì highly questionable in my
opinion ‚Äì love relationship with micro packages where applications are made up
of a carefully assembled combination of tiny libraries that perfectly cater to a
particular application's very special needs ‚Äì or in most cases, the personal
preferences of the engineer(s) setting up the project. Many teams I've talked to
over the years have strongly held opinions about what particular routing library
they need, why they cannot use the state management patterns of framework X but
have to use a different micro-library etc. And while many of these arguments
will make some sense from a purely technical point of view, the practical impact
is more often than not neglectable or irrelevant even. What's certain though is
that all the time and effort spent on assembling (and then maintaining) these
highly customized ad-hoc frameworks is **not** going into building and improving
real products for real users.

## Ember: Turning Complexity into Simplicity

Contrary to that, Ember takes these low level and mostly unimportant
[bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) decisions out
of the hands of developers. It is a full-featured, batteries-included framework
and like similar solutions for the backend like Ruby on Rails, it provides
everything one needs to build an app in a coherent way with a consistent API
where the individual parts all work together seamlessly since they were meant to
work together from the beginning. Because of that, it doesn't allow the level of
freedom and fine-grained control over every little detail that many are looking
for in the frontend world as mentioned above. And while that might sound
unappealing to many, it's actually its biggest strength as it allows teams to
focus on executing on their product and company vision and shipping real value
for their users.

### Essential vs. accidental complexity

Writing any software system means dealing with a large amount of complexity.
That complexity comes in two forms (see
[Fred Brooks' famous paper on the topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)):
essential complexity and accidental complexity. Essential complexity is how hard
something is to do, regardless of one's experience, the technology used, etc.
It's an inherent property of the problem you're solving. Adding two numbers is
generally a relatively low complexity task while building a social network has
much higher complexity in comparison. On the other hand, accidental complexity
is the part of the complexity that is not inherent to the problem one is solving
but introduced as part of the solution. Adding two numbers in C++ is more
complex than doing the same thing in JavaScript, as in C++ you have to worry
about memory management, you have to compile, etc. ‚Äì all of that isn't necessary
for JavaScript which thus leads to lower accidental complexity.

Frameworks like Ember are all about reducing the amount of accidental complexity
that the developers have to deal with. Since Ember takes care of all or the vast
majority of aspects of the application that are not an essential part of the
particular application's problem domain (e.g. routing, data loading, etc.), it
takes all of the accidental complexity associated with these aspects out of the
hands of the developers. They instead can focus on tackling the essential
complexity only. Clearly separating the aspects the developer is in control of
from everything else is therefore a
[liberating constraint](https://wiki.c2.com/?LiberatingConstraint) ‚Äì it
liberates developers from getting side-tracked and spending time on
non-essential aspects and enables them to spend their time and effort where they
truly add value. In contrast to that, building on micro packages and aiming for
fine-grained control over all of an application's aspects will necessarily
resurface all the accidental complexity associated with those and put the
responsibility for them back into the hands of developers. They now have to deal
with webpack configurations, integration between packages, etc. All effort and
time spent on these tasks are not going into delivering product value for real
users.

[![Chad Fowler (@chadfowler) on Twitter](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-12-Ember.js-in-2021---a-beacon-of-productivity/chadfowler-tweet.png#plain@600-1200)](https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/646624348028190720)

At simplabs, we have seen many teams struggling with all kinds of problems in
web projects and helped them overcome those. In none of those cases were those
problems caused by how frameworks like Ember or Rails handle the non-essential
aspects of applications. Most of the time what leads to problems is teams
struggling to organize code in a maintainable and extensible way in areas where
frameworks leave freedom and do not provide strong conventions (typical examples
being shaping and orchestrating components in Ember or organizing business logic
in Rails apps) ‚Äì in fact, the worst kinds of problems typically arise where
teams build their own extensions to frameworks that add large amounts of
accidental complexity and create more problems than they solve. I have seen at
least eight different approaches to organizing business logic in custom
constructs in Rails apps during my career and every single one eventually lead
to a dead end. The same can be said for inventing custom data management
libraries instead of relying on solutions like
[ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) or [Orbit](https://orbitjs.com).

## Stability without Stagnation

The fact that Ember hides most of the accidental complexity and takes control
over these aspects of applications doesn't mean nothing can ever change in the
framework and no progress can be had. There **is** steady and substantial
progress in the framework but Ember shields developers from having to deal with
the involved churn as much as possible. Instead, Ember constantly ships
improvements in backwards compatible minor releases with clear upgrade paths,
following its [release strategy](https://emberjs.com/releases) which emphasizes
stability. That allows teams to keep up with recent developments and benefit
from innovation in the frontend field while minimizing the incurred cost like
the team at CLARK:

[![Jan Buschtoens (@buschtoens) on Twitter](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-12-Ember.js-in-2021---a-beacon-of-productivity/buschtoens-tweet.png#plain@600-1200)](https://twitter.com/buschtoens/status/1352734272675840006)

All changes to Ember itself go through the
[RFC process](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs), are validated and tested in real
apps through the canary and beta releases before being rolled out to the
community. Once that happens, the previous APIs will remain available but be
deprecated along with extensive documentation for migrating to the new paradigms
(and in many cases there will be codemods even for automating the task; there's
also [a dedicated app](https://upgrade.emberjs.com) listing the changes between
two versions and the changes necessary for upgrading). So instead of every
single team paying the cost for exploration and experimentation, the framework
and community pay that cost once, for the entire community to benefit afterward.
That's what the Ember community also refers to as the
[safety of the herd](https://embermap.com/notes/62-safety-of-the-herd).

And Ember has seen many substantial changes to its core concepts over the years:

- [introducing a completely new component API](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/glimmer-components/)
- [replacing the core rendering engine of the framework](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-2-10-released/#changesinemberjs210)
  ([Glimmer VM](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm))
- [removing its custom object model and adopting native classes](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/native-classes/)

Each of those changes were substantial updates to the Ember programming model.
Yet, each one was released in a way that made it easy for the entire community
to follow along. The entire ecosystem revolving around a single defined set of
techniques and practices while making sure no project is left behind and stuck
on old patterns prevents fragmentation. Everyone in the community has a
collective interest in supporting, maintaining, and evolving the same set of
tools and the entire community will collectively make sure those continue to
work and work well for everyone using Ember. There is no risk on individual
teams and projects being left on their own because they bet on the wrong horse
that ends up not being actively maintained so that the teams would either have
to take over maintenance themselves or switch to a different solution which
would often result in large refactorings, again directing time and effort into
dealing with accidental complexity rather than essential complexity and
generating product value.

## The right tool for the right job

As laid out above, Ember is a full-featured application framework that contains
coherent building blocks and concepts for all aspects that real-world
applications face and that are not inherently coupled to their problem domain.
While Ember encapsulates the internals of these concepts so developers do not
have to deal with them, all these concepts are still present and contribute to
the framework's public API and general architecture that one is exposed to when
working on an Ember project. This often leads to criticism focussed on the fact
that there is a lot to learn with Ember and some or much of that might not be
necessary for a particular project

> I just want to build a calculator widget for my static site ‚Äì why do I need to
> worry about routing, data loading, error states, etc. for that?
>
> ‚Äì someone who should have chosen React

Comments like that are hard to counter. Of course, there's no good reason why
anyone should have to set up a
[route structure](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/) along with a
[template hierarchy](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/rendering-a-template/)
or understand what
[adapters](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models/customizing-adapters/) or
[serializers](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models/customizing-serializers/)
are when the application they are building does not need any of that anyway. In
reality, though, this doesn't imply Ember is unnecessarily bloated or overly
complex but the complaining person turned to a tool that serves a different
purpose than what they need for their particular job in the first place.

Even though the boundaries are sometimes blurry, there still is a substantial
difference between static or only partly dynamic web **sites** (like your
favorite news outlet's site or most e-commerce sites) and full-on web **apps**
(e.g. social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn or dashboard-style apps like the
online banking UI that [Qonto](https://qonto.com) is building). These different
use cases also come with different characteristics and requirements in terms of
interactivity, (load time) performance, and user expectations. Aral Balkan wrote
an
[interesting post in 2013](https://ar.al/notes/the-documents-to-applications-continuum/)
on the topic in which he introduces what he calls the
_"Documents-to-Applications Continuum"_ ‚Äì and what he said almost 8 years ago,
still applies today. Ember's sweet spot is all the way on the _"Applications"_
side of that spectrum:

![The Documents-to-Applications Continuum](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-12-Ember.js-in-2021---a-beacon-of-productivity/documents-to-applications-continuum.svg)

There are plenty of other and better options for other kinds of projects (and
for static content sites, I'd argue any client-side framework is the wrong
choice more often than not anyway ‚Äì however, admittedly we went through the
[exercise of completely over-engineering a static site](/blog/2020/01/31/how-to-over-engineer-a-static-page/)
as well to learn that the hard way). The point is, **if you're not building a
web application, don't look at a web application framework to build it with.**
Yet, many teams would do that and then be disappointed that the framework they
tried does not turn out to be a great fit. To me, that's a bit like complaining
SpaceX's rockets aren't great to do grocery shopping with. A rocket not being an
ideal choice for that task doesn't mean it's a bad rocket, just that advanced
technology designed for tackling challenging tasks isn't necessarily also a
great fit for simpler tasks.

## A productive future with Ember

Ember has never been the coolest kid on the block and probably never will be.
Building on solutions others have found before you isn't a particularly
attractive outlook for many developers. It takes quite a bit of experience and
reflection to let go of one's vanity and accept that the less you do yourself
and the more you build on existing, proven solutions, the better of an
engineering job you're actually doing and the better your work is in the
interest of the company you build or work for which is ultimately the top
priority as it is what's paying the bills and salaries. Ember developers
[frequently are the highest-paid and most senior in the annual state of JS survey](https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_salary_heatmap)
and I don't think that's a coincidence.

[![Vlad Mihalcea (@vlad_mihalcea) on Twitter](/assets/images/posts/2021-03-12-Ember.js-in-2021---a-beacon-of-productivity/vlad_mihalcea-tweet.png#plain@600-1200)](https://twitter.com/vlad_mihalcea/status/1350775611434930177)

Ember has been an enabler of great productivity for many teams for almost a
decade and I'm sure it's going to continue to be that. It's changed and improved
a lot since its first release and is now in better shape than ever with its
[Octane edition](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/). All those changes and
improvements were introduced with minimal effort for teams to stay up to date
and migrate their apps in small steps over time. There also is little to no
fragmentation within the community ‚Äì everyone using Ember.js is basing their
work on the same idioms and techniques, all originating from the same highly
cohesive ecosystem. And when more changes and improvements are to come in the
future, they will be battle-tested **before** migrating the community, and that
migration will take everyone along, leaving no app behind.

[Qonto](https://qonto.com) and [CLARK](http://clark.de) are two great examples
of teams executing on their product vision steadily and sustainably. The
companies are two of the most successful and fastest-growing FinTechs in Europe
and have scaled their teams significantly over the past few years while
continuing to ship steadily and sustainably. But they are not the only ones
using Ember successfully of course ‚Äì others include companies building ambitious
apps with large and growing teams like LinkedIn, Apple, Square, Heroku,
Intercom, and many more. All those teams might generate little fuzz and hype but
ship product value constantly and will continue to do so building on Ember which
will keep lifting them to new heights for the time to come.

Tired of unexpected bloated builds slowing down your app? Meet [Gravity](https://gravity.ci) by [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com), your new CI/CD tool for keeping bundle sizes in check, effortlessly.

## What is Gravity?

_Gravity_ automatically tracks build size changes in your pull request. If your bundle gets bigger, _Gravity_ flags it for approval. Otherwise, you can merge with confidence.

This ensures that accidental increases in asset or binary sizes don‚Äôt hit production, helping you maintain the performance of your applications together with a good user experience.

### Why We Built It?

Performance regressions sneak in when you least expect them. With teams shipping updates multiple times a day, keeping an eye on bundle size growth can feel impossible. But ignoring it leads to slow load times and a frustrating user experience.

That‚Äôs why we built _Gravity_, a smooth way for product teams to stay on top of performance without tedious manual reviews.

<!-- TODO: Find an external resource on what happens when you have very large bundle sizes in your websites -->

Here are some cases where you might want to use _Gravity_:

- Catch unminified HTML/CSS/JS files
- Catch images not properly compressed
- Prevent a new version of your library from being published that is too large
- Avoid unexpected bloated bundles when installing an update of a dependency
- Catch dead code you don't need to publish

## How Does It Work?

You can setup _Gravity_ in minutes! It's as simple as:

1. Installing [_Gravity_'s GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/gravity-ci)
2. Adding a few lines to your GitHub Action to run _Gravity_ on your pull requests.

Every time you open a pull request, _Gravity_ uploads the bundle to a remote server and analyzes it.

Once the analysis is complete in the remote server, Gravity will create a [status check](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) in you pull request. Depending on the analysis result, Gravity will report if the bundle size increased or not.

### The _bundle size_ did **not** increase üìâ

In case the bundle size did **not increase**, the status of this check will be **success (Approved automatically) ‚úÖ**, so there is no extra action to be taken.

### The _bundle size_ increased üìà

In case the bundle size **increased**, the status of this check will be **failure (Needs approval) ‚ùå**.

In this case, Gravity expects the team to decide if the reported increment is expected or not. If it's not expected, the author of the pull request has to address the issue. If the increment of bytes is expected, Gravity expects a reviewer to access the Gravity Dashboard and approve the bundle increase.

By accessing the Gravity Dashboard, the reviewer can see, in a quick eye-scan, which files have increased in size, and how much.

Once this is done, the Gravity PR Check will become **approved** and can be merged.

We just released excellent 1.7.2 which includes the following fixes:

<!--break-->

- fixed `Simplabs::Excellent::Checks::Rails::CustomInitializeMethodCheck`
- fixed `Simplabs::Excellent::Checks::MethodNameCheck` so it allows method names
  that exist in Ruby itself
- fixed `Simplabs::Excellent::Checks::GlobalVariableCheck` so it doesn't report
  false positives for rescue bodies
- made the parser more forgiving/stable in some situations

  <p>In today's business and technology world, the traditional approach of tightly managed work processes is reaching its limits. Companies that dare to break the conventional norm are discovering the untapped potential of unguided work. By encouraging experimentation and accepting the possibility of failure, companies can create an environment that fosters innovation and empowers their teams to reach new heights of productivity and creativity.</p>

## Embracing Experimentation and Failure

1. **Team Culture and Mindset**: Cultivating a culture that allows for
   experimentation and failure is critical. Encourage open communication and
   reassure team members that trying new ideas and learning from mistakes is not
   only accepted but celebrated. Acknowledge and reward innovation efforts,
   regardless of their outcome.
2. **Solid Tools and Infrastructure**: To effectively foster unguided work,
   organizations must provide their teams with the right tools and
   infrastructure. Version control systems like Git, collaboration platforms
   like Slack and Notion, and solid continuous integration and deployment
   pipelines are essential to streamline development processes and enable rapid
   experimentation.
3. **Bug Prevention Mechanisms**: While it is essential to avoid bugs, it is
   equally important to set up an environment that minimizes the impact of bugs.
   Implement automated testing and robust monitoring systems to detect and
   prevent potential problems early.

## Mainmatter's Experience with Unguided Work

At Mainmatter, we've seen the transformative power of unguided work in action.
Here are a few key aspects of our experience:

### Open Source Work: A Testament to Unguided Collaboration

Open Source projects epitomize the value of unguided work. Hundreds of thousands
of developers worldwide contribute to these projects, often in their spare time,
without direct supervision. This collaborative and unguided approach has given
rise to some of the most influential and widely used software in the world, such
as Rust.

### Embracing Flexibility: Working Whenever and Wherever

The traditional 9-to-5 work model is no longer the only viable option. Embracing
unguided work means acknowledging that people can be at their best at different
times and locations. Offering flexibility in working hours and remote work
options empowers individuals to find their optimal productivity zones and leads
to better work-life balance.

### Async Work and Distributed Teams

Moving away from traditional meeting-heavy approaches, asynchronous
communication has become a hallmark of unguided work. Distributed teams can
collaborate effectively through platforms like Notion and GitHub, reducing the
need for constant synchronous meetings.

Shopify introduced its Meeting Cost Calculator in July 2023, helping estimate
the cost of meetings. By getting rid of three meetings a week per person, the
company expects a 15% cost reduction. (Read

### Time for Experimentation and Learning

Following the concept promoted by Google, our team members spend
20% of their work time on open source projects and experimenting with new ideas.
This "creative time" has yielded remarkable results, as several innovations have
found their way into new projects.

## Rethinking Project Management

In the context of unguided work, the role of project management evolves. Instead
of rigidly being on top of progress and timelines, letting go of those
constraints is at the core of unguided work. Teams experiment, learn, and adapt
constantly, with project management’s main role being to make sure things are on
track in the right general direction.

Solid developer tooling, infrastructure, and practices enable teams to
experiment and fail without causing havoc. We’ve worked with many international
teams over the years and helped them set up and improve automatic testing and
deployment, incremental rollout strategies, quality assurance, and other
mechanisms that can raise a team’s ability to experiment.

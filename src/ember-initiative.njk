    <h2 class="h2">Why Sponsor?</h2>
    <p class="text-section__text">
      Companies that have invested into Ember depend on the healthiness and longevity of the
      ecosystem. They cannot risk Ember becoming legacy technology, requiring expensive rewrites in
      the worst case. Supporting the Ember initiative for them means securing much larger
      investments they have made in the technology. Depending on the sponsorship tier, sponsors
      further benefit from regular office hours and pairing sessions, as well as being able to
      contribute to the initiative's quarterly roadmap.

    <p class="text-section__text">Embroider is of crucial importance for the future of Ember. It will enable new capabilities planned for Polaris, allow decreasing bundle sizes, and open a path towards to benefitting from modern build tooling like Vite. Embroider remaining unshipped represents a substantial risk for the entire Ember ecosystem and for the investments that companies have made that build on Ember.</p>

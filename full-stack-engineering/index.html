          Although software disrupts existing markets and creates new ones, not all businesses need to build up software engineering know-how internally. Poorly architected systems and slow development cycles can have dramatic negative consequences.
        </p>
        <p>Instead, focussing on their own core strengths while getting software engineering <strong>help from an experienced partner can make software an enabler for success rather than a liability</strong>.</p>"

                  <p class="lead mb-4">simplabs has an experienced team of technology experts that have worked together for years. Our clients <strong>benefit from the productivity of a smooth-running team from day one</strong>, avoiding the delay of ramping up a newfound in-house team over weeks and months.</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                    Our engineers are experts in the technologies that we use. In fact, we actively contribute to the tools and frameworks we build our projects with and thus have deep, internal knowledge, resulting in high productivity and quality.

              We value conventions-based frameworks that result in maintainable and well-defined projects which
              are easy to take over by our clients once we've left, allowing to <strong>internalize engineering
                when the time is right</strong>.

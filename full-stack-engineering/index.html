    <p>Although software disrupts existing markets and creates new ones, not all businesses need to build up software engineering know-how internally. Poorly architected systems and slow development cycles can have dramatic negative consequences.</p>
    <p>Instead, focussing on their core strengths while getting software engineering help from an experienced partner can make software an enabler for success rather than a liability.</p>

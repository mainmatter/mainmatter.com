          The team approached simplabs when they needed help laying the <strong>foundation for advanced features</strong>
          in their Elixir and Phoenix based API as well as making sure their Ember.js based client was following
          best practices.

          simplabs' team built prototype implementations for a number of advanced features in Expedition's
          system. Leveraging Elixir's and Phoenix's capabilities we were able to implement advanced mechanics
          with clean and concise code with significantly less effort and complexity compared with more
          traditional tools.

        <p class="lead">
          Expedition's in-house team was able to expand on our foundational work, <strong>handed over in an open and well-communicated way</strong>.

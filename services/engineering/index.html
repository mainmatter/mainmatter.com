        <p>Although software disrupts existing markets and creates new ones, <strong>not all businesses need to build up software engineering know-how internally</strong>. Poorly architected systems and slow development cycles can have dramatic negative consequences. Instead, focussing on their own core strengths while <strong>getting software engineering help from an experienced partner can make software an enabler for success rather than a liability</strong>.</p>

        <p>simplabs has an experienced team of technology experts that have worked together for years. Our clients <strong>benefit from the productivity of a smooth-running team</strong> from day one, avoiding the delay of ramping up a newfound in-house team over weeks and months.</p>

      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
        <p>Our engineers are experts in the technologies that we use. In fact, <strong>we actively contribute to the tools and frameworks</strong> we build our projects with and thus have <strong>deep, internal knowledge</strong>, resulting in high productivity and quality.</p>

        <p>We value <strong>conventions-based frameworks</strong> that result in maintainable and well-defined projects which are easy to take over by our clients once we've left, allowing to <strong>internalize engineering when the time is right</strong>.</p>
        <p>We can also <strong>help with building up an internal engineering team</strong> and getting that up to speed in terms of know how and process - see our <a href="/services/team-augmentation/">team augmentation</a> and <a href="/services/training/">training</a> offerings.</p>

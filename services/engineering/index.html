        <h3>Focus on your strengths</h3>
        <p>Although software disrupts existing markets and creates new ones, <strong>not all businesses need to build up software engineering know-how internally</strong>. Poorly architected systems and slow development cycles can have dramatic negative consequences. Instead, focussing on their own core strengths while <strong>getting software engineering help from an experienced partner can make software an enabler for success rather than a liability</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Take over once you're ready</h3>
        <p>We value <strong>conventions-based frameworks</strong> that result in maintainable and well-defined projects which are easy to take over by our clients once we've left, allowing to <strong>internalize engineering when the time is right</strong>.</p>
        <p>We can also <strong>help with building up an internal engineering team</strong> and getting that up to speed in terms of know how and process - see our <a href="/services/team-augmentation/">team augmentation</a> and <a href="/services/training/">training</a> offerings.</p>

        <h2>The best of all worlds</h2>
        <p>Elixir combines the <strong>expressiveness and simplicity of Ruby</strong> with the performance and stability of the <strong>Erlang VM</strong>. Phoenix builds on the concepts first introduced by Ruby on Rails, combining them with a number of architectural improvements. Together, they form a <strong>modern and capable stack for building ambitious projects</strong> based on an established and <strong>battle-proven foundation</strong>.</p>

        <p>simplabs was an <strong>early adopter of Elixir and Phoenix</strong>, offering <a href="https://elixir-phoenix-workshop.simplabs.com">trainings</a> and leveraging the potential of the stack for our <a href="/work/">clients</a> early on. We are organizing the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Elixir-Munich/">Elixir Munich</a> meetup and have been <strong>actively involved with conferences</strong> like <a href="https://elixirconf.com/">ElixirConf</a> and <a href="https://elixirconf.eu/">ElixirConf EU</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="engineering">Full Stack Engineering</a></h2>
        <p>Software is eating the world, overthrowing existing business models and enabling new ones. <strong>Building up Software Engineering know-how internally is hard</strong> though and not something that is reasonable for all businesses in every situation. It is often more efficient to get <strong>help from an experienced partner</strong> and <strong>focus on the core strengths of the business</strong> instead.</p>
        <p>simplabs turns ideas into successful products, working closely with our clients in short iterations. Our solutions are well architected and <strong>easy to maintain and extend by our clients once they are ready to take over</strong> themselves.</p>

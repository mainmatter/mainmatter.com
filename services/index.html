        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p>simplabs builds solutions for the web and mobile devices for everyone from small startups to big enterprises. Our solutions are <strong>well architected and easy to maintain and extend</strong> by our clients once we have left.</p>
          <p>We turn our client's ideas into successful products by <strong>taking over projects completely</strong> and working closely with the client's Product Team in short iterations.</p>
          <p>For clients that have in-house developers already, we can <strong>augment that existing team</strong> to help reach delivery deadlines or improve quality. By working with our experienced experts, the client's developers will be able to <strong>extend and deepen their knowledge</strong> in the respective technologies.</p>

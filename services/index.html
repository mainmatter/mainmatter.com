          <p>Software is eating the world, overthrows existing business models and enables new ones. <strong>Building up Software Engineering Know How internally is hard</strong> though. It is often more efficient to get <strong>help from an experienced partner</strong> and <strong>focus on the own core strengths</strong> instead.</p>
          <p>simplabs turns ideas into successful products, working closely with our client's product team in short iterations. Our solutions are well architected and <strong>easy to maintain and extend by our clients once we have left</strong>.</p>

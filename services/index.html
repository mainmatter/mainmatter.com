          <p>simplabs builds solutions for the web and mobile devices for everyone from small startups to long-established businesses. Our solutions are <strong>well architected and easy to maintain and extend</strong> by our clients once we have left.</p>
          <p>We turn our client's ideas into successful products by <strong>taking over projects completely</strong> and working closely with the client's product team in short iterations.</p>
          <p>For clients that have an in-house engineering team already, we can <strong>augment that team</strong> to help reach delivery deadlines or improve quality. By working closely with our experienced experts, the client's engineers will be able to <strong>extend and deepen their knowledge</strong> in the respective technologies.</p>

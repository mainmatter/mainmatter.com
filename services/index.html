        <h2>Full Stack Engineering</h2>
        <p>Software is eating the world, overthrowing existing business models and enabling new ones. <strong>Building up Software Engineering know-how internally is hard</strong> though and not something that is reasonable for all businesses in every situation. It is often more efficient to get <strong>help from an experienced partner</strong> and <strong>focus on the core strengths of the business</strong> instead.</p>
        <p>We turn ideas into successful products, working closely with our clients in short iterations. Our solutions are well architected and <strong>easy to maintain and extend by our clients once they are ready to take over</strong> themselves.</p>

        <p>Not all engineering teams have the experience or confidence to make big decisions and complete large scale projects on time and budget. Our <strong>technology experts can merge with our clients' in-house engineering teams</strong>, spearhead development initiatives, <strong>establish best practices and install a smooth process</strong>.</p>

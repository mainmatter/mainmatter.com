    <h3>Expedition</h3>
    <p>Expedition is an online travel magazine for global citizens. It lets travellers experience the world's best destinations through the eyes of a local.</p>
    <p>The team approached simplabs when they needed help laying the <strong>groundwork for some advanced features</strong> in their Elixir and Phoenix based API as well as making sure their Ember.js based client was following best practices.</p>

    <p>simplabs' team built prototype implementations for a number of advanced features. Leveraging <strong>Elixir's and Phoenix's capabilities</strong> we were able to implement <strong>advanced mechanics with clean and concise code</strong> that would have taken much more effort and resulted in significantly higher complexity with other technologies. Expedition' team benefitted from our foundational work, <strong>handed over in an open and well-communicated way</strong>.</p>

    <h3>The Whiskey Diaries</h3>
    <p>The Whiskey Diaries is an online travel magazine for global citizens. Bla bla.</p>
    <p>The team approached simplabs when they needed help laying the <strong>groundwork for some advanced features</strong> in their <a href="/services/elixir-phoenix/">Elixir and Phoenix</a> based API.</p>

          <p>simplabsâ€™ expertise with Elixir and Phoenix helped us find the best approach for implementing some of our advanced features. They left us with cleanly written and well tested implementations that were easy for us to take over and build upon.</p>

    <p>We built prototypes for a number of features for The Whiskey Diaries. Leveraging the <strong>patterns that Elixir and the Erlang VM provide</strong> we were able to implement <strong>advanced mechanics with clean and concise code</strong> that would have taken much more effort and resulted in significantly higher complexity with other technologies. The Whiskey Diaries' team benefitted from our foundational work that we <strong>handed over in an open and well-communicated way</strong>.</p>

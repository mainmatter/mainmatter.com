    <h3>DD-WRT</h3>
    <p>DD-WRT is a Linux based <strong>firmware for wireless routers</strong>. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, it now runs on a wide variety of models and is <strong>installed on millions of devices worldwide</strong>.</p>
    <p>When embeDD, the company behind DD-WRT, was looking to rebuild the old web interface and put the project on a stable foundation that would support development efforts for the long term, they reached out to us for advice.</p>

          <p>simplabs’ expertise in developing Ember.js based applications helped us significantly to define and develop the new DD-WRT NXT user experience. It was impressive to see in what short time such a complex application leveraging a customer backend interface could be implemented. simplabs' work did provide the new foundation for our UI and our in-house development team greatly benefitted from their know how.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>We <strong>built the first prototype based on Ember.js in just over 6 weeks</strong>, defining the structure for the application and establishing good Ember.js patterns. That prototype laid the foundation for subsequent engineering efforts taken on by embeDD's internal engineering team. In order to enable the client to continue the project successfully and ensure it would be a long term success, we <strong>coached their internal development team and reviewed their work</strong> for an extended period of time after having handed over the project.</p>

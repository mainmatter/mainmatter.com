description: |-
  Elixir's combination of modern language features, and a 30-year-old battle-tested foundation at its core, has made it increasingly popular over the past year.

  This course provides a strong foundation for writing general-purpose functional code, and is intended for developers already proficient in another language.
stages:
- title: Writing Modular Programs
  description: Elixir's module system allows us to define layers of related functions.
    In this part of the course, we'll explore the concepts of modules, and the ability
    to reference code in one module from another.
  duration: 240
- title: Working With Data Structures

    with the established and battle-tested Erlang ecosystem. '
  duration: 120
- title: Types, Operators & Control Flow
  description: 'Our journey starts with basic types and procedural logic. Even if
    you''re experienced in a wide range of programming languages, there''s going to
    be a lot of stuff -- even at this basic level -- that may change the way you look
    at writing code forever.

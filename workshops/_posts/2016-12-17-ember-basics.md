- title: Testing
  description: |-
    A great testing story is a critical part of any serious tech stack, and the Ember community has put a lot of time into making this a great strength of the framework. We'll cover examples and best practices in areas of :
    * Unit testing
    * Component integration testing
    * Acceptance testing
    * Mocking data
    * Writing sustainable tests
  duration: 240
- title: Routing & Top-Level Templates
  description: One of the important ideas at the core of Ember is URL-driven application
    state. Great state management is what makes the difference between single page
    apps that delight users, and those that frustrate them.

- title: Objects, Properties & Actions
  description: |-
    Nearly all of Ember's important types extend from a core `Ember.Object` class, which we'll study, and compare to JavaScript's `Object` and `Class` concepts.

    Some types of ember objects, like Routes, Controllers and Components can **handle user interactions by way of actions**. We'll cover strategies and best practices for action handling, including:
    * the `{{action}}` helper
    * closure actions
    * action bubbling
    * the `{{route action}}` helper
    * the `{{mut}}` helper

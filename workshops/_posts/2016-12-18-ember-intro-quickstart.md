In this abbreviated intro course, you'll get a taste for what the Ember.js framework has to offer. We'll focus on two of the most important aspects of building a single page app: **routing and components**.

By the end of this course, you'll have a sense for what Ember offers, and will understand how it's a totally different choice, compared to React or Angular 2.

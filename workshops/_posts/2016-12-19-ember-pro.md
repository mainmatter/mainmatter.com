  We'll go **way** beyond the fundamentals, tackling topics like authentication, advanced debugging techniques, server-side rendering, modular app design.

  This course is designed to help developers already familiar with Ember.js to unlock the true power of the framework.
stages:
- title: Managing Complexity
  description: Ambitious apps have a tendency to be inherently a little complex. We'll
    look at a few battle-tested ember addons that have emerged as the go-to solutions
    in their domains, and leverage this third party code to enrich our app while keeping
    complexity under control.
  duration: 290
- title: Booting and Building
  description: It makes sense to begin at the beginning. We'll thoroughly examine
    how your ember app is built and how it boots up, getting a little hands-on experience
    with the parts of the framework that glue all of your application code together.
  duration: 320
- title: State Management II
  description: Particularly when working in an environment like the browser, where
    some things are fast, and some things are really slow, it behooves us to set some
    state management ground rules, so we don't run into trouble as our app grows in
    size and complexity.

- title: Professional Patterns
  description: Knowing how things work is one thing, but knowing how they're used
    by experts in the wild will help you learn the easy way instead of the hard way.
  duration: 270
- title: Modular Architecture
  description: "One of the unique strengths of the Ember ecosystem is the concept
    of an Ember Addon.\n\nThe big recent advancement in this area over the past year
    is the concept of  **engines**, a special kind of addon that essentially is an
    app in and of its self, embedded or mounted in the consuming app. \n\nTomorrow's
    ember apps will take advantage of all of these great capabilities, so we'll thoroughly
    study the various building blocks, and cover some important and broadly useful
    scenarios. "

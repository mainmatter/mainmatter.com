category: Front End Development
description: "Ember-cli is truly a world class build tool, and it's more capable and
  versatile than most people think! \n\nWe need look no further for proof of its impact
  than angular-cli and react-create-app, as continuations of the idea that Single
  Page Apps are deserving of first class tools, optimized for their specific needs."
stages:
- title: Apps & Addons
  description: The contents of your `ember-cli-build` file is on center stage when
    consuming ember-cli's asset pipeline features. We'll dive into some features exposed
    by way of the EmberApp and EmberAddon objects, using some familiar tasks as case
    studies.
  duration: 210
- title: Broccoli Basics
  description: Broccoli is a fast, robust and portable asset pipeline, built with
    ember-cli in mind. It uses node's `fs` module as it's API, and is deliberately
    designed to steer users away from potential snags.
  duration: 120
- title: Codegen & Commands
  description: |-
    Ember-cli's blueprints and command features are incredibly powerful, and are tremendously under-utilized in the ember community. In this unit, we'll explore:
    * How apps (and addons contained therein)  can extend ember-cli
    * How arguments passed to ember-cli on the command line make it into your blueprint or command
    * Testing on the node.js side

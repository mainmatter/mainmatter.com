EmberConf 2022 is happening online on April 19th. As always, the simplabs team
will be joining the conference and giving talks. This year, Chris Manson will
explain how you can reduce the struggle of adopting new linting rules in
modestly sized apps and happily lint all the way to modern Ember at your own
pace.

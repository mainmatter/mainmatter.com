Rust has become one of the most popular new programming languages in recent
years. The combination of performance on the level of C++ with stability and
security on the level of managed languages like C# or Java is attractive to many
development teams. This remote workshop offers participants an introduction to
the world of Rust. It takes place over 5 afternoons, from the 10th to 13th of
May, 13:00 to 18:00 CEST each day.

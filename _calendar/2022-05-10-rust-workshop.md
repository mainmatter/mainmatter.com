Rust has become one of the most popular new programming languages in recent
years. The combination of performance on the level of C++ with stability and
security on the level of managed languages like C# or Java is attractive to many
development teams.

The workshop will take place from the 10th to the 13th of May, from 1pm to 6pm.

          <h3>Our Process</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p>We are <strong>enthusiastic about agile practices</strong> and a flexible development process. While we don't think planning is evil per se, <strong>we don't overplan and aim to keep the process lean</strong>. Projects start off with a kick-off workshop to get everybody on the same page and then iterate in one or two week long sprints. We <strong>require clients to actively participate</strong> in projects and will communicate openly and often - not only to give status updates but also to explain <strong>the how and why behind design decisions we make</strong>.</p>

    <p>DD-WRT is a Linux based <strong>firmware for wireless routers</strong>. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G series, it now runs on a wide variety of models and is <strong>installed on millions of devices worldwide</strong>.</p>
    <p>When embeDD, the company behind DD-WRT, was looking to <strong>re-engineer the old web interface</strong> and put the project on a stable foundation that would support development efforts for the long term, they reached out to simplabs for guidance.</p>

    <p>Shipping a single page app bundled with a router firmware is substantially different from serving it via the open web. The first step for us was to <strong>understand the characteristic aspects of the environment</strong>, like limited hardware capabilities and slow update cycles. We then came up with an approach for the project based on Ember.js that was <strong>tailored to the particular requirements and limitations</strong> of the use case.</p>

          <p>simplabs’ expertise in developing Ember.js based applications helped us significantly to define and develop the new DD-WRT NXT user experience. It was impressive to see in what short time such a complex application leveraging a customer backend interface could be implemented. simplabs' work did provide the new foundation for our UI and our in-house development team greatly benefitted from their know how.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>We <strong>completed the prototype implementation of the architecture</strong> in just over 6 weeks, defining the structure for the application and establishing good Ember.js patterns. That prototype laid the foundation for subsequent engineering efforts taken on by embeDD's in-house engineering team.</p>
    <p>In order to enable the client to continue the project successfully and ensure it would be a long term success, we <strong>coached their engineers and reviewed their work</strong> for an extended period of time after handing over the project.</p>

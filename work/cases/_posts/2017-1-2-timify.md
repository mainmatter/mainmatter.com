        <p>Timify is an online appointment scheduling calendar for businesses that connects service providers with clients. It helps businesses acquire clients, improve their customer service and spur revenue without forcing it.</p>

        <p>After Timify had validated their business model with an internally-built prototype and the business was growing, it became clear the prototype wouldn't be a solid foundation for the future. They <strong>needed to rebuild the entire application</strong>, that was focused around a central calendar, allowing clients to manage and create appointments. The <strong>new system was supposed to serve as the foundation for the foreseeable future</strong> and needed to be built on a reliable and maintainable architecture. Timify reached out to simplabs to lead the initial development of that system.</p>

        <h2>delivering high quality in time</h2>
        <p>We built the first version of the application for Timify in 4 months, allowing them to meet their investor's deadline. After the initial release we joined forces with Timify's in-house team that had been built up in the meantime, <strong>teaching best practices and ensuring modern and idiomatic Ember.js patterns were followed</strong> in the engineering process.</p>
        <p>After the initial release we also lead development of advanced features like premium plan subscriptions along with payment system integration as well as localization of the application in 15 languages and support for time zones. </p>

        <p>Ember.js proved to be a great technology choice for a complex application like Timify. The baked in conventions ensured that even once the app grew to a significant size and several people were involved in its development, the code base remained consistent and maintainable. <strong>Leveraging SVG for the main calendar view</strong> we were able to achieve decent runtime performance even for large data sets. The JSON API based server API allowed us to implement the client and server side of a feature concurrently.</p>

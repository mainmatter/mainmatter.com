        <p>After Timify had validated their business model with a prototype built in-house, as the business was growing it became clear the prototype wouldn't be a solid foundation for the future. They <strong>needed to re-engineer the entire system</strong>, making sure it was based on a solid foundation that <strong>would enable them to iterate fast without sacrificing quality</strong>.</p>

        <h2>delivering high quality in time</h2>
        <p>We built the first release version of the application for Timify in 4 months, allowing them to meet their internal deadlines. After the initial release, we joined forces with Timify's in-house engineering team, <strong>teaching best practices and ensuring modern and idiomatic Ember.js patterns were followed</strong>. This way, we were able to <strong>ensure long-term success for Timify's in-house team</strong>, based on the foundation we had laid.</p>
        <p>Our technolog experts also <strong>spearheaded several engineering efforts</strong> focused around premium subscriptions along with payment system integration, localization of the application in 15 languages and support for time zones.</p>

        <p>Ember.js proved to be the right technology choice for an ambitious application like Timify that was built to last for years. The baked in conventions enable larger teams and applications to <strong>move fast without breaking things</strong>.</p>
        <p>Leveraging <strong>modern web technologies like SVG</strong> for the main calendar view, we were able to achieve decent runtime performance even for large data sets. The JSON API based server API allowed us to implement the client and server side of a feature concurrently.</p>

        <h2>sustainable added value</h2>
        <p>Besides working on the core application, simplabs <strong>spearheaded several engineering efforts focused around mobile performance</strong>, improved load times, server side rendering and localization. We <strong>established modern and idiomatic practices for developing mobile apps</strong> and helped Trainline's in-house engineering team internalize those through code reviews.</p>
        <p>In addition to supporting Trainline with engineering resources and expertise, we were able to help <strong>improve the engineering process</strong> by establishing and solidifying a sprint based approach. This resulted in more efficient prioritization and a better sense of progress by both engineers and management.</p>

          <h3>Our Toolbox</h3>
          <p><strong>Ember.js, Elixir and Phoenix</strong> as well as Ruby on Rails are the foundation of our toolbox. The <strong>convention-based approach</strong> that they all share make them a great fit for successful <strong>projects that stay healthy over a long time</strong> and are simple for our clients to take over once we have left.</p>

          <p>We will however choose whatever technology is best suited to get a particular job done, which in some cases might not be one of the above three. We keep our eyes open and <strong>love exploring new technical opportunities</strong>.</p>

          <h3>Our Process</h3>
          <p>We are <strong>enthusiastic about agile practices</strong> and a flexible development process. While we don't think planning is evil per se, <strong>we don't overplan and aim to keep the process lean</strong>. Projects start off with a kick-off workshop to get everybody on the same page and then iterate in one or two week long sprints. We <strong>require clients to actively participate</strong> in projects and will communicate openly and often - not only to give status updates but also to explain <strong>the how and why behind design decisions we make</strong>.</p>

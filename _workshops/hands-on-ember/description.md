Ember.js is the frontend framework for ambitious teams that never stop shipping
without getting lost in low-level rabbit holes.

This workshop covers all relevant aspects of the framework. It targets beginners
that are just starting new with Ember as well as teams that are using the
framework already and are looking to deepen their knowledge.

### The Workshop

We go through a series of stages that each build on one another. Each topic is
introduced via an in-depth presentation as well as a small, focussed demo
application that illustrates the respective concept in practice. Over the course
of the workshop we take participants through building a full Ember application
step by step so each topic can be applied hands-on with the support of our
tutors. Depending on each team's needs and previous experience, we will cover
each topic in varying depth. The workshop can be done in 2 days or stretch over
3 days.

### Customized for your team

Different teams have different needs and levels of experience with Ember. The
workshop can be done for beginners as well as more experienced developers by
covering different topics in different levels of depth. We are also happy to
customize workshops for the specific needs of a team and cover topics like
performance, debugging, upgrading from older versions of Ember or topics
particular to a team's application.

The workshop can be done remote or on-site although we recommend on-site if
possible.

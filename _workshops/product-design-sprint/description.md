Product design sprints are a step-by-step process for product design. They were
originally developed by Google, and are now used in top companies all over the
world. Ideas are tested and validated with real users in just five days.

### The Workshop

The first step is to assemble a cross-functional team with the goal of aligning
on a challenge and collaborating to create a solution. Each day of the product
design sprint is focused on one goal: aligning, exploring solutions, deciding,
prototyping, and finally testing.

### After the workshop

After a design sprint, we often run a second iteration sprint. In this iteration
sprint, the focus is on refining the prototype. We apply the feedback that we
received in the sprint and test it once again with our users.

### Customized to your team's needs

Design sprints are customized to your team and your needs. Although we enjoy
collaborating with your team in every step of the way, we can also tailor the
workshop so your team is only present for a fraction of the time.

> From the first day, we started realizing **how much better** our first product
> could have been if we had used a **design sprint**. Building and designing our
> app became a team effort and involved our users.This brought about a product
> that was **supported by the team** and **wanted by our users**.

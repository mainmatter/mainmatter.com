Although Git is everyone's version control system of choice, it can sometimes
seem overwhelming and cause developers headaches instead of supporting them in
their work.

In this one day workshop, we explore the fundamental concepts of Git and via
hands-on exercises focused around day-to-day tasks show how to get the most out
of it.

### The Workshop

The workshop covers all relevant aspects of Git in just enough detail to be able
to efficiently use it day-to-day without being overwhelming or overly academic.
We focus on real challenges developers face when working with Git and give them
the understanding of the foundational concepts as well as practical guidance to
overcome those challenges. The workshop is split into several blocks that each
include a presentation that introduces a topic, followed by an exercise to apply
the learnings hands-on with the support of our trainers.

### Customized to your team's needs

We're happy to customize the workshop to precisely fit your team's specific
needs or challenges. If you have a very specific branching model or
infrastructure or your team frequently struggles with particular aspects of Git,
we can adapt the focus of the workshop more towards these aspects or cover
additional topics as necessary.

All content and examples of the workshop are

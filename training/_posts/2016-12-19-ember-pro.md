stages:
- title: Booting and Building
  description: It makes sense to begin at the beginning. We'll thoroughly examine
    how your ember app is built and how it boots up, getting a little hands-on experience
    with the parts of the framework that glue all of your application code together.

  - title: Container, Loader and Resolver
    description: |-
      Like many opinionated web frameworks, most of the code developers write is in hooks: important functions that are called in a predictable way, which may be extended to customize behavior.

      When things appear to go wrong between hooks, being able to peek into a few of the important framework internals can be incredibly valuable. We'll cover three important concepts that will start to give you visibility into what may have previously been a black box

  - title: 'EXERCISE: Consume ES5 modules in ES6'
    description: Using our knowledge of the loader, let's put a file in our `/vendor`
      folder to make an ES6 module available in our app in totally different namespace.

  - title: Initializers
    description: |-
      If you've ever copied and pasted a code from a library's source, in order to customize a little behavior within a complex internal process, you've likely felt the pain of keeping your customized behavior in sync with upstream changes to the library.

      Ember's boot process was built with customization in mind, and provides a mechanism for inserting our own custom code at various places in startup process. These bits of code are called initializers and instance-initializers.

      We'll build on our knowledge of the container, and use the Registration API to prepare it for our app, in some initializers and instance-initializers of our own.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '10:15'
    duration: 30
  - title: 'EXERCISE: Container setup in an Initializer'
    description: We only want our app to boot up once we have geolocation data. Retrieving
      this from the browser is an async process, so we'll need to ensure we halt the
      boot process until it's complete. Once data has been retrieved, put it in the
      container under the `data:location` key,  in such a way that we only have a
      single copy of the object used across the whole app.

  - title: Building with Broccoli
    description: |-
      Broccoli is the asset pipeline used by ember-cli, and it has one job: transforming and combining files. While the core broccoli library is great, some of the most important build-related stuff happens inside the many broccoli plugins that are used to transpile, minify, uglify and analyze your source code.

      We'll build our own broccoli plugin, explore some debugging techniques and learn some broccoli best practices.

      JavaScript files. Do so by way of a broccoli plugin. \n\n**Note:** you may end
      up tampering with files after the've already been fingerprinted, so you may
      need to remove `ember-cli-sri` from your project."

  - title: A Simple CI/CD Scheme
    description: |
      One of the distinct advantages of working with an opinionated framework is that many people are working with the same set of libraries and tools.
      Continuous integration and continuous deployment typically take a lot of effort to set up, but in the ember world, it's incredibly easy! We'll use Travis-CI and Heroku (coincidentally, two both apps) to automatically test  and deploy new code that's pushed to our project's GitHub master branch.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '13:00'
    duration: 20
  - title: 'EXERCISE: Github + Travis-CI + Heroku = Easy CI/CD'
    description: "Set up free continuous integration w/ Travis-CI, create a new app
      on Heroku using the ember-cli build pack, and have Travis automatically deploy
      in the event that tests pass.\n\n**BONUS:** setup a heroku pipeline, and enable
      PR apps, so you can view and play with proposed changes before merging PRs! "

  - title: Fastboot
    description: |-
      Ember's server side rendering technology is incredibly easy to set up, particularly in comparison to getting something equivalent working in ecosystems that are less opinionated and aligned to a common set of ideas.

      Although both browsers and Node.js both run JavaScript, there are a couple of very important differences that we need to be aware of, as we prepare our app for Fastboot.
    item_type: lecture

    duration: 30
  - title: 'EXERCISE: Ready, Set, Fastboot!'
    description: Install `ember-cli-fastboot`, and run `ember fastboot --serve-assets`.
      You'll find that something we're doing is making our lightweight and incomplete
      DOM implementation unhappy. Use our knowledge of Fastboot guards to fix this
      problem (i.e., skip it if we're running in fastboot land).

- title: State Management I
  description: Particularly when working in an environment like the browser, where
    some things are fast, and some things are really slow, it behooves us to set some
    state management ground rules, so we don't run into trouble as our app grows in
    size and complexity.
  duration: 85
  agenda_items:
  - title: Addressable State
    description: 'Addressable state is essentially anything that''s directly represented
      in the browser''s URL. Poorly managed addressable state can lead to problems,
      where the browser''s back button doesn''t do what your user expects. '

    description: "Add a feature where we can type a name fragment in our project's
      search field in order to filter the list of records.\n* This should be done
      in a **data down, actions up** way\n* Reduce the number of API calls made if
      you can\n* Ensure that you don't break browser history \n"

  - title: Draft State & WeakMap
    description: 'When a user spends some effort creating some state (i.e., a comment
      on a GitHub issue), it''s important to protect them from losing it by way of
      an accidental swipe, press of the browser''s back button, or a file drop in
      the browser''s window.

  - title: 'EXERCISE: Draft comments'
    description: We want to be able to make comments, and first we want to ensure
      that we don't allow users to accidentally discard their draft comments. Additionally,
      we need to ensure that drafts are always associated with the appropriate record
    item_type: exercise
    start_time: '9:45'
    duration: 30
  - title: Persisted State
    description: You're no doubt familiar with persisted state, and using ember-data
      to help you manage it. However, when doing anything asynchronous, we have to
      keep context and life cycles in mind.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '10:15'
    duration: 30
  - title: 'EXERCISE: Saving comments'
    description: |-
      When a user wants to save a comment, it should be persisted to the API. Please implement this feature and meet the following requirements
      * Once a save has successfully completed, the appropriate draft state should be cleared
      * Your solution must behave as expected in a high-latency environment
    item_type: exercise
    start_time: '10:45'
    duration: 30
  - title: UI State
    description: |-
      UI State is often pertinent to the presentation layer only, is only relevant "in the moment", and can in fact be harmful if not discarded and given a clean start if a user leaves and comes back.
      You may be thinking that component member data is the tool for the job, but it's more nuanced than you think!
    item_type: lecture

  - title: 'EXERCISE: UI State'
    description: |-
      We have a little metadata area at the top of each record, and want to allow users to expand and collapse it to their heart's content! Implement this feature, and meet the following requirements:
      * The expand/collapse state should not carry over from one record to another as we navigate around
      * If we expand the metadata area on a record, then go somewhere else, and then come back, we should see things as we left them

- title: Managing Complexity
  description: Ambitious apps have a tendency to be inherently a little complex. We'll
    look at a few battle-tested ember addons that have emerged as the go-to solutions
    in their domains, and leverage this third party code to enrich our app while keeping
    complexity under control.

  - title: Concurrency
    description: "Promises are soooo 2016. We'll do a few things with ember-concurrency,
      a library that leverages the power of Generator Functions to help us manage
      asynchronous tasks with grace and poise. \n"

    duration: 30
  - title: Animation
    description: A little tasteful animation can make a world of difference, in making
      your app feel rich and interactive. We'll look at a few easy to use features
      in Ember's official animation library, liquid-fire, whose "big idea" is making
      animations **declarative**.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '14:15'
    duration: 45
  - title: 'EXERCISE: Animated Comment Count'
    description: We have a small comment count indicator in the list of records on
      the left side of the screen. Use liquid fire to animate this so that it rolls
      over "odometer style" when comments are added or removed.
    item_type: exercise
    start_time: '15:00'
    duration: 30
  - title: Logic in Templates
    description: |-
      As you start building a sizable app, it's easy to become annoyed at all of the repetitive computed properties that usually come along with conditionals, filtering and transforming data, and mutating values.
      We'll look at two libraries
      * ember-composable-helpers
      * ember-truth-helpers

      That allow us to express simple logic declaratively in templates.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '15:30'
    duration: 30
  - title: 'EXERCISE: Public vs Private Comments'
    description: |-
      Good news! We have a new feature whereby comments can be made either in "fact" or "opinion" mode .
      * Using only a `<select>` element, composable helpers, and minimal imperative code in JavaScript files, add a drop down allowing the user to pick between comment types when creating a comment
      * Add a filter to the top of the list, allowing us to pick from three modes "fact", "opinion" or "all"
      * In "all" mode, facts should be sorted higher on the list than "opinions", but they should otherwise be sorted by createdAt within each category.
    item_type: exercise
    start_time: '16:00'
    duration: 45
  - title: Authentication & Authorization
    description: |-
      Authentication is often the first big thing we end up building into a new app, and the approach ember-simple-auth takes has clearly resonated with the Ember community. By building a small set of single-purpose JavaScript modules, and mixing a few things into a few foundational framework objects, we can have authentication working in no time!
      We'll go a step further and explore the concept of roles, whereby users are granted or denied access to certain routes, based on some data associated with their user object.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '16:45'
    duration: 20
  - title: 'EXERCISE: Login/Logout'
    description: "The API we've been using supports authentication via OAuth2 Password
      Grants. Implement \"logging in\", and unlock the ability to post non-anonymous
      comments.\nAdd a \"Logout\" button to the navbar, which should\n* make a `DELETE`
      request to the same endpoint we use for login, and then \n* invalidate the client-side
      session"

  - title: CRUD Mixins
    description: |-
      There are several types of repetitive routes that most apps end up needing for the following purposes

      * Creating a new record
      * Updating an existing record
      * Showing a record
      * Showing a list of records

      We'll devise a common abstraction for each of these, and DRY up our code by establishing some conventions within our project.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '9:15'
    duration: 45
  - title: 'EXERCISE: CRUD Mixins'
    description: Let's DRY up our routes for showing a list of records, and the route
      for creating a new record, by building some general purpose mixins.

  - title: ES2016, ES2017 & ES2018  in Ember
    description: |-
      You're no doubt aware of new language features coming to the JavaScript world, but since some of us have years of experience writing ES5 code, it's hard to develop new habits that take advantage of the new stuff.

      We'll look at some ideal places to apply destructured assignment, enhanced object literals, ES6 classes, async/await and more, with a specific focus on how the new ideas mix well with Ember.

    description: 'ember-cp-validations takes an approach to validating ember-data
      records (or really, any `Ember.Object` subclass) that''s built entirely using
      computed properties. We''ll look at how to apply this library, customize error
      messages, display them on the screen, and even integrate with ember-data to
      surface server-side errors in the UI.

- title: Modular Architecture
  description: "One of the unique strengths of the Ember ecosystem is the concept
    of an Ember Addon.\n\nThe big recent advancement in this area over the past year
    is the concept of  **engines**, a special kind of addon that essentially is an
    app in and of its self, embedded or mounted in the consuming app. \n\nTomorrow's
    ember apps will take advantage of all of these great capabilities, so we'll thoroughly
    study the various building blocks, and cover some important and broadly useful
    scenarios. "
  duration: 240
  agenda_items:
  - title: Addon Basics
    description: 'Ember addons can exist as their own independently-versioned separate
      projects, or as **in-repo addons** that live within a host app''s  `/lib` folder.
      There are **major** benefits to both of these patterns, so once we cover some
      common addon basics, we''ll outline important differences and practical use
      cases for each. '
    item_type: lecture

    duration: 45
  - title: Module Namespaces, Resolver Consequences
    description: 'Typically, when working with addons, you have two top-level folders:
      `app` and `addon`, each of which may contain familiar folders like `components`,
      `routes`, etc... . We''ll connect back to our newfound knowledge of the container,
      loader and resolver, to understand important consequences of putting certain
      types of files in each tree.'

  - title: 'EXERCISE: Modifying a host app''s asset pipeline'
    description: Addons are the go-to way of building up an app's asset pipeline in
      a modular way.  We'll look at the different places that we can get access to
      important Broccoli trees, and cover some important distinctions between being
      consumed in apps vs other addons vs engines.
    item_type: exercise

    duration: 30
  - title: Route-less Engines
    description: Engines are a powerful new capability, similar in concept to the
      idea of Rails engines, for embedding a sub-application into a host app. This
      is a departure from non-engine addons, in that the engine has its own registry
      & container, can have its own initializers, services, etc...
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '15:45'
    duration: 30
  - title: Routed Engines
    description: We've already embedded a route-less engine into a view, so let's
      take things to the next level and mount a routed engine in our router. We'll
      need to introduce a few new concepts relating to how engines share information
      with the host app, and pay special attention to the way we create `{{link-to}}`  components
      that cross the host/engine boundary.
    item_type: lecture
    start_time: '16:15'
    duration: 30
  - title: Lazy Engines
    description: |-
      Beyond encapsulation, one of the biggest benefits that come along with engines is that it frees us from having to pile our entire app into one big set of static assets, to be downloaded as the user first enters. Lazy engines allow chunks of assets to be downloaded on an as-needed basis, as a user crosses an engine boundary.

      Although this adds a little extra complexity to our apps, the performance payoff can be huge, particularly if infrequently-used sections of your app are particularly heavy in terms of dependencies and application code.

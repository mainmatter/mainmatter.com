      "<p>
          DD-WRT is a Linux based firmware for wireless routers. Originally designed for the Linksys WRT54G
          series, it now runs on a wide variety of models and is <strong>installed on millions of devices
            worldwide</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When embeDD, the company behind DD-WRT, was looking to re-engineer the old web interface and put the
          project on a stable foundation that would support development efforts for the long term, they reached
          out to simplabs for guidance.

          <p class="lead mb-4">
            Shipping a single page app bundled with a router firmware is substantially different from serving it
            via the open web. The first step for us was to understand the characteristic aspects of the
            environment, like limited hardware capabilities and slow update cycles. We then came up with an
            approach for the project based on Ember.js that was <strong>tailored to the particular requirements
              and limitations</strong> of the use case.

        <h2 class="font-weight-black text-dark-blue mb-4">The Solution</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          We completed the prototype implementation of the architecture in just over 6 weeks, defining the
          structure for the application and establishing good Ember.js patterns. That prototype laid the
          foundation for subsequent engineering efforts taken on by embeDD's in-house engineering team.

          <p class="lead mb-4">
            In order to enable the client to continue the project successfully and ensure it would be a long term
            success, we <strong>coached embeDD's engineers and reviewed their work</strong> for an extended
            period of time after handing over the project.

            simplabs’ expertise in developing Ember.js based applications helped us significantly to define and
            develop the new DD-WRT NXT user experience. It was impressive to see in what short time such a complex
            application leveraging a customer backend interface could be implemented. simplabs' work did provide the
            new foundation for our UI and our in-house development team greatly benefitted from their know how.

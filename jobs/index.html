          <h3>What we're looking for</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p>We're looking for a JavaScript Frontend Developer for our office in Munich, who likes to work in a small but very international team. We're a team of openminded and forward thinking developers who are passionate about well crafted code. Beyond a great team culture and a relaxed work atmosphere in our office in the city center (we're actually right next to the Isar!) - we offer an execiting range of projects for clients ranging from small startups to big enterprises, national as well as international. We work closely with our clients and usually join a shared Slack channel with their teams. You'll have responsibility early on and have a large impact on client projects. We also offer the opportunity to travel internationally - either to visit clients on-site for a limited time or to attend Tech Conferences (if you like to speak and submit CFPs that's awesome!).</p>
          <p>We start the day with our daily standup in which everyone on the team gives an update on what they worked on the previous day and what they plan to do on the current day. Apart from that we're pretty lean and don't have a lot of process. We practice a feature branch based workflow with continuous testing and peer reviews.</p>
          <p>Apart from working on client projects we also maintain a bunch of open source libraries and tools on which you'll work on as well.</p>
          <p>As we focus quite heavily on convention over configuration based frameworks we're looking for someone who appreciates the value that this concept provides for projects instead of reinventing the wheel over and over.</p>

                    Our clients range from small local and international startups to enterprises. </p>
                  <p>We focus on web engineering with <strong>Ember.js, Elixir/Phoenix and Ruby on Rails</strong> and are consistently involved in these open-source communities.
                    Events we're organizing include Rails Girls Munich, the Elixir User Group Munich among others.
                    We also want to ensure that our workshops and other events organized by us are accessible to a wide part of the tech community by ensuring these events are free or
                    by providing diversity sponsorships for people who are underrepresented in tech.</p>

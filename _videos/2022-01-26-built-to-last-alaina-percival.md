simplabs' founder Marco Otte-Witte interviewed Alaina Percival, CEO and
Co-Founder of Women Who Code, the largest and most active community of technical
women in the world, serving nearly 300â€™000 technologists in 134 Countries.

In the interview, Alaina talks about the barrier female technologists are put up
against and their need to constantly prove themselves to their male colleagues.
To fill the gap of representation in the tech world, she explains, the industry
does not only need to make sure they hire more diversely, but also that they are
retaining the talented women who are already there and that will become role
models for future generations.

Alaina also gives recruiters a few tips on how to become more diverse: expand
where you are looking, examine why diverse candidates are dropping out, and
finally be an active part of the community.

Lastly, Marco and Alaina talk about the importance of having diverse employees
and different perspectives in one team to enhance innovation within the company.

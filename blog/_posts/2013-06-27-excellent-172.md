We just released excellent 1.7.2 which includes the following fixes:

<!--break-->

* fixed `Simplabs::Excellent::Checks::Rails::CustomInitializeMethodCheck`
* fixed `Simplabs::Excellent::Checks::MethodNameCheck` so it allows method names that exist in Ruby itself
* fixed `Simplabs::Excellent::Checks::GlobalVariableCheck` so it doesn't report false positives for rescue bodies
* made the parser more forgiving/stable in some situations

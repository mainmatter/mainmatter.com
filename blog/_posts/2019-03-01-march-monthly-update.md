##Looking back

February was full of events and some interesting work spent on our 20% days. Here's a run down.

### Ember.js film premiere!

We were very pleased that our CEO Marco Otte-Witte was featured alongside Ember.js co-creators [Yahuda Katz](https://twitter.com/wycats) and [Tom Dale](https://twitter.com/tomdale) in the HoneyPot's new film ["Ember.js - The Documentary"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvz-9ccflKQ)!

The film was premiered at meetups across Europe and we'd like to thank [Honeypot](https://twitter.com/honeypotio) for putting it together!

### 20% days - Sponsoring Ricardo Mendes - Ember.js Core Team

At Simplabs we follow Google's 20% rule where each person gets to 1 day per week on a project of their choice.

In January and February we were very pleased to sponsor [Ricardo Mendes](https://twitter.com/locks) from the Ember.js Core Team. Chris Manson spent his 20% time pairing with Ricardo on [Guidemaker](https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template) to add features to help the Ember Octane documentaton process and released a 1.0 of Guidemaker!

### Events

_We're always interested in new speakers for the various meetups we're involved in. If you'd like to give a talk, [get in touch!](https://simplabs.com/contact/index.html)_

February was a busy month for events. Below are some of the highlights.

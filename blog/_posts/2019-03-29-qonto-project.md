We're very pleased to announce that we've started working with [Qonto](https://qonto.eu/), a Paris based VC funded startup who are "the ideal banking alternative for freelancers, startups and SMEs."

Often when we start with new clients we together choose [Team Augmentation](https://simplabs.com/team-augmentation/index.html) as the method of working.

This method of working sees our technology experts merge with our client's in-house engineering teams to share and their know-how. simplabs engineers spearhead and guide new development initiatives while establishing best practices and tranferring knowledge to in-house engineers on the job via reviews and pairing sessions.

Just as with previous Team Augmentation projects like [trainline](https://simplabs.com/trainline/index.html) this approach brings "double value for the client" says simlpabs CEO Marco Otte-Witte, "short term value is added by the client immediately gaining more engineering power, but additional long term value is added through improved architecture, code quality, processes and leveled up in-house engineers."

For the project at Qonto, simplab's Tobias Bieniek started by analyzing their code and found the templates were using the rather antiquated Emblem.js which nobody was really happy with but also nobody knew how to migrate away from. To tackle this Tobias created and open sourced [emblem-migrator](https://github.com/simplabs/emblem-migrator/) which Qonto and all other Emblem.js users can use.

Next simplabs engineers identified that Qonto's test suite speed was impeding progress. They showed Qonto's engineers how to analyse the underlying causes and then half the testing time.

simplabs CEO Marco Otte-Witte says "I'm really pleased that simplabs have been able to add so much value in such a short amount of time proving that our team augmentation method works. We're all looking forward to continuing the project and helping Qonto to succeed in their highly competitive market."

Every good open source project needs a nice and shiny logo these days. It would be great if Ember.SimpleAuth had one as well. As I’m not really an expert in these things it would be great if some of the more artistic advanced contributors/followers could [contribute something](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/152)!

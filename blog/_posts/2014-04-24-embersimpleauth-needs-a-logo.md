Every good open source project needs a nice and shiny logo these days. It would be great if Ember.SimpleAuth had one as well. As Iâ€™m not really an expert in these things it would be great if some of the more artistic advanced contributors/followers could [contribute something](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/152)!
